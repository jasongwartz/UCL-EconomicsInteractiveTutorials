This tutorial discusses average cost, and gives some typical uses of the average cost concept, and 
shows the distinction between average cost and marginal cost.</p>

<h2>Average cost example</h3>
<p>Imagine that you have a toy factory.</p>
<p>Your an annual fixed cost is $10000.  This fixed cost covers loan interest, utilities, property taxes, etc. 
Suppose the marginal cost of producing each toy is $1.  This is labor and materials.</p>
<blockquote>If you need it, there is a <a href="#sambakerChapterschapter2section1">tutorial that explains marginal cost.</a></blockquote>

It's easy to confuse average cost with marginal cost. Marginal cost
is the cost of adding or subtracting one unit of output.</p>

<p>The average cost includes a portion of the fixed cost, as well as variable
cost. The marginal cost includes only variable cost.</p>
<p>Suppose someone asks, "What is the cost of producing a toy?"  He or she might want the average cost or he or she might want the marginal cost.  You have to guess which from the context of the question.</p>
