<p>Here's the basic point about discounting future income, in the form of a question:</p>

<h2>Time Preference</h2>

In my reply to the above question, I emphasized the existence of interest-paying bank accounts. There's a more fundamental reason why present income is worth more than future income: time preference.
<b>Time preference</b> is preferring income today to getting the same income in the future. Economists assume that pretty much everybody has time preference, and here is why:

Life is short. Suppose you're broke (for many students, that's not too hard to imagine) and you need a car today to be able to drive to the job you want. Working and saving to buy a car someday may not be your best option. If the job you want pays better, you'll be better off borrowing money to buy a car now, even though you'll have to pay interest to the lender. Because there are always people in this circumstance, for whom borrowing is a good idea, there is a market for loanable funds, and that's why there are bank accounts that pay interest. The existence of these bank accounts in turn means that even if you don't have a pressing need for money now, you're still better off getting it now than getting it later.

(One exception to the time preference rule is that some people like to have their future money held for them so they don't spend it carelessly now. Here at USC, years ago, some faculty who got paid only from August to May asked the payroll office to take a slice out of each paycheck and hold it until the following summer. These faculty didn't trust themselves to save for the summer on their own. At first, the University paid no interest on the deferred income. Even so, many faculty signed up. Only some years later did the University offer a plan that paid interest on this deferred salary.)
