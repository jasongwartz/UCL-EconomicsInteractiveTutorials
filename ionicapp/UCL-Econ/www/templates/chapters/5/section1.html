		<p>Elasticity is a measure of responsiveness. It tells how much one thing
changes when you change something else that affects it.
<p>For example, the elasticity of demand tells us how much the quantity
demanded changes when the price changes. The elasticity of demand measures
the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in the price charged.
<p><i>Elasticity = Responsiveness</i>
<p>The following discussion mostly uses the elasticity of demand for its
examples. The elasticity concept can be used for other things, too, like
supply or income.
<h2>
Elastic and Inelastic</h2>
Elasticity is a noun. The adjective form, "elastic," means something is
highly responsive to changes in something else. For example, elastic demand
means that the quantity demanded changes a lot when the price changes.
Inelastic demand means that the quantity demanded does not change much
when the price changes. In class, we'll get more precise about where to
draw the line between elastic and inelastic. For now, though, let's start
with the qualitative idea:
<p>Elastic = Responsive
<p>Inelastic = Unresponsive
<p>By the way, if this usage of "elasticity" as "responsiveness" seems
peculiar, it's because it is peculiar. Economists are about the only people
who use "elasticity" this way. But, if you want to understand economists,
you need to understand "elasticity." I suppose you could find an analogy
between the elasticity of demand and the elasticity of rubber, but that
would be stretching it.
<p>"Elastic" and "inelastic" can be used to describe supply or demand.
Let's use them with demand.</p>
<p>In each of the following examples, choose whether you would expect demand
to be elastic or inelastic.  
<p>Don't worry, for now, about the precise mathematical definition of what's elastic and what's inelastic.  
Choose "Elastic demand" if you think that buyers will buy somewhat less if the price goes up, or somewhat more if the price
goes down.  Choose "Inelastic demand" if you think that the buyers will buy about the same amount if the price goes up or down.

<p class="question">A family has a high-deductible health insurance policy.  This means that the family must pay all its medical bills until it has spent, maybe, $6000.  Suppose that the family has not spent that much on medical care yet, and now one of the children has an earache.  What would their demand be like
for an office visit to get this checked out?
