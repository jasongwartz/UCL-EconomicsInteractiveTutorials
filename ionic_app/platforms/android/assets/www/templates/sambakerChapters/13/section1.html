    <h1>Risk Aversion and Insurance</h1>

    <p>The <a href="#sambakerChapterschapter12section1">interactive tutorial on risk</a> calculated the expected values of some games and securities. It made a connection between the expected value of a security and its market price. This use of the expected value is based on the Law of Large Numbers, which is a statement about what happens when a game is repeated over and over and over again. If a game can be repeated many times, good luck and bad luck tend to wash out.</p>

    <p>What happens, though, if the game isn't going to be repeated over and over? What if it's only played once, or a few times, in your life? What if the stakes are very high, so that you are gambling with something that you really do not want to lose? That's when <b>risk aversion</b> comes in.</p>

	<p><b>Risk averse</b> means being willing to pay money to avoid playing a risky game, even when the expected value of the game is in your favor.</p>

	<p>Let's find out how risk averse you are. If you are a student, I'm guessing that £10,000 is a lot of money for you. A gift of £10,000 would make your life noticeably easier. Losing £10,000 would make your life noticeably harder. If you're a well-paid executive or professor (Ha! Ha!), multiply my dollar numbers by ten, or a hundred.</p>

	<p>Imagine that you're a contestant on a TV game show. You have just won £10,000. The host offers you a choice: You can quit now and keep the £10,000, or you can play again. If you play again, there is a 0.5 probability that you will win again, and wind up with £20,000. If you play again and lose, you lose your £10,000 and take home nothing. You quickly calculate that the expected value of playing again is £10,000, the same as sticking with the £10,000 you have won so far.</p>

	<question qid="riska1"></question>

	<br><p>Did your answer to the question above show risk aversion? If it did, let's try to measure how risk averse you are. We can do this by changin the game in one of two ways:
	
	<p>1.) We can raise the payoff for winning on the second play above £20,000, and see if you still choose to stick with the sure £10,000.</p>

	<p>2.) Alternatively, we can raise the probability of winning on the second play, and see if that changes your choice.</p>

	<p>Either of those alternatives raises the expected value of playing again, so that it's above £10,000. If we raise the expected value of playing again, will that induce you to take a chance? Let's see...</p>

	<p>For example, would raising the payoff to £22,000 for winning the second time enough to get you to take the risk and play?</p>

	<question qid="riska3"></question>

	<br><p>The higher your answer was to that question, the more risk averse you are.</p>
