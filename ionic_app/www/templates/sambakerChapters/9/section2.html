Bank Account Math</h3></center>

Let's go over the math of bank accounts:

<p>Suppose we put $200 in a bank account and leave it there for a year.
The bank account pays 5% interest at the end of each full year.  </p>
<blockquote>Nowadays, 1% would be more realistic, but I'll use 5% to get more nice round numbers in the calculations.  <br>5% is 1/20, by the way, so 5% of 200 is 200/20.</blockquote>
