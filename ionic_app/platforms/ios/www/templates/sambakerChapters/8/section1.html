Monopoly Price and Output</h1>

<p>This tutorial shows how, in theory, a business firm that monopolizes
its industry finds the price and output rate that maximize profit.</p>
<p>A "monopoly," in economics jargon, is the sole seller of its product.&nbsp;
The way this is represented mathematically is to give the firm a downward
sloping demand curve.&nbsp; This means that a monopoly is a firm whose
demand is not perfectly elastic.&nbsp; The monopolist can change the price,
and the result is that the amount sold changes.&nbsp; This is contrast
to a competitive firm, which must sell at the going price, take it or leave
it, but can sell an unlimited amount of product at that price.
<p>The monopolist is a "price maker," not a "price taker."</p>
<p>This may seem like a too broad a definition of monopoly.&nbsp; Is Wendy's,
the fast food chain, a monopoly?&nbsp; Their demand is not perfectly elastic
-- they can raise their prices without having the quantity demanded drop
to zero.</p>
