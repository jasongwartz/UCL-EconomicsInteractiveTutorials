	<p>For this example, I posited the probability that the country would pay off the bill. How would you make that judgement in practice?</p>

	<p>Some economists argue that the market can tell us what the probabilities are. By comparing a security's market price with the market price of a bond that will surely be paid off, one can calculate what the market "thinks" the probability of default is.</p>

	<p>We can show how this is supposed to work by turning our current example around.</p>

	<p>Suppose one-year £10,000 treasury bills issued by the U.S. (and therefore sure to pay off [if you ignore the crazy wing of the Republican party]) are selling for £9803,92. Country X's one-year £10,000 treasury bills are selling for £8823.53. What does the market think is the probability that Country X will actually pay?</p>

	<p>We run the calculation above backwards.</p>

	<p>8823.53/9803.92 = 0.9</p>

	<p>The market says that the probability of Country X failing is 0.9 or 90%.</p>

	<p>That doesn't really answer the question of you should set the probability. If you are deciding how to invest your money, or your institution's money, or your city's money, you have make your own judgement. Hopefully, you won't wind up in jail like the former Jefferson County, Alabama, County Commission President. His county went broke in 2008 after he invested county money in what the market thought were low-risk bond swaps.</p>

	<p>This example shows the basics. It could be made more realistic by adding more possible outcomes than just paying in full or paying nothing, such as partial payment or deferred payment. The same method works: List the possibilities, calculate what each is worth today, and multiply each worth by your best guess of the probability of that happening.</p>

	<p>In July 2011, the European Union announced a deal that amounted to a controlled partial default for Greece. Greek bonds would be paid at 80% of their face value. For example, a bank that had lent 1,000,000 Euros to Greece will get 800,000 Euros, plus interest payments based on £800,000 rather than £1,000,000. Greek bonds went up in price after the announcement. They had been selling at a discount that was greater than 20%.</p>

	<p>By the way, in 2008, as the banks got scared and stopped lending money, some cable news commentators said that investors had gotten "risk averse," and that is why risky securities lose market value. This is <b>not</b> what risk averse means. What happened in 1998 and 2008 and some years in between was that investors changed their assessment of how big the risks were. You may have a certain attitude about gambling on a security with a 90% probability of paying off. Some news event may cause you to think that the probability of paying off has dropped to 50%. Your attitude toward a 90%-sure bet doesn't necessarily change. What changes is that the security no longer offers a 90%-sure bet. So the price you would pay for that security will be much lower, even without any change in your attitude toward risk, which is what risk aversion is about. More about that in the next tutorial.</p>
