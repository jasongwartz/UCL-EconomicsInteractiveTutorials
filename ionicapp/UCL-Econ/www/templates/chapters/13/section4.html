		<p>In the power function, <img SRC="powerfunction.gif" BORDER=0 height=33 width=96 align=ABSCENTER>, b is the elasticity of Y with respect to X. When X 
changes by 1%, Y changes by b%. For risk averse people, b is
less than 1, so utility is relatively inelastic with respect to changes
in income.
<p>On this graph, the slope changes as you go from left to right, but the elasticity is the same everywhere, thanks to our using the power function.  
<p>To summarize, Von Neumann and Morgenstern recast your choice from being
about different amounts of dollars to being about different amounts of
utility. This lets them preserve the principle that one should always
choose the alternative with the highest expected value.&nbsp; The down
side is that they have to bring in an imaginary quantity, "utility," that is
impossible to observe directly.
<p>Maurice Allais, an economics Nobel winner, pointed out that people don't
always behave as the Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory says. Here's a version
of one of his examples:
<p>Imagine that you may spin one of two Wheels of Fortune, A and B. Each
has 100 numbers on it. For each wheel, the probability that any particular
number will come up on any one one spin is 1/100. You only get to play
this game once. The wheels pay off like this:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><strong>Wheel A</strong></td>

<td><strong>Wheel B</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="WheelA.png" width=377 height=213></td>

<td>
<img src="WheelB.png" width=377 height=213></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Numbers 1 through 10 pay $1 million
<br>Numbers 11 through 100 pay nothing</td>

<td>Numbers 1 through 9 pay $5 million
<br>Numbers 10 through 100 pay nothing</td>
</tr>
</table>
Wheel A offers a slightly better chance of getting rich. Wheel B
offers a lot more money if you win. Which would you choose?
<br>
    <input type="radio" name="riska5" value="A">A: 10% chance at $1 million.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="riska5" value="B">B: 9% chance at $5 million.</input>
<div id="riska5-answer" class="question"></div>
<p><p>Now consider this game, which you would also get to play only once:
<table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" >
<tr>
<td><strong>Wheel C</strong></td>

<td><strong>Wheel D</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<img src="WheelC.png"></td>

<td>
<img src="WheelD.png"></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Numbers 1 through 100 pay $1 million.&nbsp;
<br>You are sure to win $1 million.</td>
<td>Numbers 1 through 9 pay $5 million.
<br>10 pays nothing.
<br>11 through 100 pay $1 million.</td>
</tr>

</table>
Which would you choose now?
<br>
    <input type="radio" name="riska6" value="C">C: 100% chance at $1 million.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="riska6" value="D">D: 90% chance at $1 million.  9% chance at $5 million.  1% chance of no prize.</input>
<div id="riska6-answer" class="question">I'm leaving some space here so you won't be influenced by what Von Neumann, Morgenstern, or Allais would have expected you to pick.
