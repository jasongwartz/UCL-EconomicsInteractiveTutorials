<h2>
How Present Value Changes When the Discount Rate Changes</h2></center>
So far, we've done everything with a discount rate of 5%. Now let's see
how the changes in the discount rate affect the present value.
<p>For variety, let us use a $1000 face-value bond with a maturity of 10 years and no risk that it won't be paid.  (You can actually buy a U.S. Treasury bond like that.  The only risk is that someday Republicans in Congress may block the Treasury from paying out money.)</p>

<center><h2>The Net Present Value of an Income Stream</h2></center>
<p>Suppose you have an investment that pays off on several occasions, not just once at the end.  To get the total present value of such an "income stream," to use the economics jargon, you calculate the present value of each payment and then add them up:</p>
<div class="card padding">
<p>Present value = <br>(Income in year 0)  / ( 1 + discount rate )<sup>0</sup> <br>+ (Income in year 1)  / ( 1 + discount rate )<sup>1</sup> <br>+ (Income in year 2)  / ( 1 + discount rate )<sup>2</sup> + ... and so forth.  </p>
</div>
<p>If Income in year 0 includes your initial cost, as a negative, <small>(for that matter, all of your yearly income numbers should include any outlays during those years.)</small> then you have:</p>
<div class="card padding">
<p>Net Present value = <br>(Net income in year 0)  / ( 1 + discount rate )<sup>0</sup> <br>+ (Net income in year 1)  / ( 1 + discount rate )<sup>1</sup> <br>+ (Net income in year 2)  / ( 1 + discount rate )<sup>2</sup> + ... and so forth.  
</p></div>
<p>If your incomes and expenses come at other intervals, monthy, for example, then you would use monthly discount rates rather than annual.</p>

<p>The net present value is used for deciding whether to do an investment or not.  </p>

<p>For example, if a 10-year zero-coupon $1000 Treasury bond is selling for $762.40, the net present value is:</p>
<p>-762.40 / ( 1 + discount rate )<sup>0</sup> + 10000  / ( 1 + discount rate )<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>Plug your discount rate into that formula.  If the net present value is positive, buy the bond.  If it is negative, don't.</p>
<div class="card padding">
<blockquote>If you have cash lying around, your discount rate is the interest rate you could get by lending the cash to somebody.  If you do not have spare cash, your discount rate is interest rate that you would pay to borrow from somebody.</blockquote></div>

<h3>Spreadsheet for calculating net present value</h3>
</center>
The box below this paragraph has a spreadsheet set-up for calculating the
net present value of an income stream. To use it, select the contents of
the box.
Copy, then paste to the upper left corner of a blank worksheet in 
Microsoft Excel
or other spreadsheet program. 
The discount rate and income stream numbers are samples, of course, 
that you can change.
Row 5 has two sum formulas, one for Excel 
and one for Lotus and Quattro Pro. To extend the spreadsheet for a longer income 
stream, copy E2:E4 and paste across row 2 as far as needed.

<div class="card padding">
Discount rate	0.05			
Year	0	=B2+1	=C2+1	=D2+1
Income stream	-1000	100	100	100
Present value	=B3/(1+$B1)^B2	=C3/(1+$B1)^C2	=D3/(1+$B1)^D2	=E3/(1+$B1)^E2
Net present value	=SUM(B4:E4)	@SUM(B4..E4)
