		<h3>Supply and demand as the two sides of a market</h3>
<p>Let's consider, for example, a market for local primary care services.
<p class="question">
On which side of this market are primary care physicians in
office-based
practices? Are they on the Demand side or the Supply side?
<br>
<input type="radio" name="sd1" value="demand">Demand</input>
<input type="radio" name="sd1" value="supply">Supply</input>
<div id="sd1-answers"></div>

<p>When they have illnesses or
injuries, or fears of illness, 
people decide whether to seek medical attention. Presumably,
they
base their decisions on their assessments of how much they are likely
to
benefit from being seen by a medical professional, versus how much it
will
cost to be seen. 
<p>The cost to them includes 
<ul><li>what the provider makes them
pay
<li>transportation expense
<li>any foregone wages or business income
<li>whatever else they might have done with their time.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I will simplify that when I talk about demand in this tutorial.  I will just look at what people have to pay and how that affects how much they want to buy.  I
will hold constant all the other costs that consumers incur to obtain primary care.</p>
