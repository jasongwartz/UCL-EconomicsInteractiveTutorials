		<h3>When does raising your price bring in more money?</h3>
<p>For demand, there's a relationship between the elasticity and what happens
to total revenue from customers when you change your price:
<table><tr valign="top"><td>If demand is elastic</td>
<td>(if the elasticity is more negative than -1)</td>
<td>then if the
price goes up,<br>the total amount customers spend goes down.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>If demand is inelastic</td>
<td>(if the elasticity is between -1 and 0)</td>
<td>then if the
price goes up,<br>the total amount customers spend goes up.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>If you have unitary elasticity</td>
<td>(if the elasticity of demand is exactly -1)</td>
<td>then if the
price goes up,<br>the total amount customers spend stays the same.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>Suppose that you were in charge of setting prices at a hospital.  You offer trauma services in your emergency department.  You also offer counseling for weight control in your education department.  Each of those services has an incremental cost, mainly for personnel and supplies to provide the service.  Your hospital also has overhead costs, like the construction loan for your building and your salary as an administrator.  To get the revenue to cover the overhead costs, you will have to mark up the prices on some services to levels well above what is needed to cover just the incremental costs.  Think about the price elasticity of demand for emergency department services and for education department services.  </p>

<p>Elastic demand typically happens when you are a small player in a big
market, and there's a going market price. Undercut that price, and you
attract business. Whether you make a profit depends on your costs, but
that's a subject for another tutorial.</p>
<p>The extreme form of elastic demand is perfectly elastic demand.  Perfectly elastic demand means you can sell as much as you want at the going market price.  People will buy a practically unlimited amount at the current price, with no need for price cuts to get people to take more.</p>

<p>
Small sellers of commodities (standardized products) in big markets can have demand that is perfectly elastic.  A small farmer, for example, may find that the market will take all he or she can produce at the going price.
