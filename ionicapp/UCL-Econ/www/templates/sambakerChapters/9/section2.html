Bank Account Math</h3></center>

Let's go over the math of bank accounts:

<p>Suppose we put $200 in a bank account and leave it there for a year.
The bank account pays 5% interest at the end of each full year.  
<blockquote>Nowadays, 1% would be more realistic, but I'll use 5% to get more nice round numbers in the calculations.  <br>5% is 1/20, by the way, so 5% of 200 is 200/20.</blockquote>
After one year, after the 5% interest is paid, <span class="question">how much will be in the account?</span>
<br><input id="dis2-response" name="dis2" type="text"></input>
<button id="dis2-button">Type a number in the box.  Then click this.</button>
<div id="dis2-answer">Do not type a $ sign.  Just a plain number.</div>
<div id="dis2A-answer">
<p>Leaving space until the above question is answered correctly.
