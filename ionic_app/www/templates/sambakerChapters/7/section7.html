		<h2>Adjusting the Equilibrium Quantity to Equal the "Need"</h2>
Sometimes, in public health, you may decide that some people
"need" to use a certain amount of some service. For example, you might
set a goal that everyone should get immunized, or that every pregnant
woman
should get prenatal care.
<p>We can represent that in the supply and demand diagram with a
vertical
line at the quantity that we think people need. It's a vertical line
because
"need" is the same regardless of the price.</p>

<br /><br />
When the supply-demand intersection point is to the left of the "need"
level, then the amount actually bought or sold is less than the "need."
One way to raise the actual amount bought and sold is to raise demand. The diagram
above
shows that if you raise demand, you can move the equilibrium quantity out to
the "needed" level. As the diagram also shows, this tends to raise the
price.
</p>
<p>For this to work, the supply curve can't be so steep that it does not reach the Need line.  
In real life, this would mean that raising demand works if the supply will be forthcoming if the price goes high enough.</p>
<p>The alternative way to get the equilibrium quantity out to the need is to raise supply.  This means moving the supply
curve
to the right. As the preceding video showed, raising the supply curve makes 
quantity go up and makes the price go down.

<p><h3>Here are some more tactics for manipulating where the supply and demand
curves
cross. See if you can tell which do that by changing demand and which
by changing supply.</h3>

<p>In the movie above, I have the demand curve stopping its move to the right when the equilibrium quantity gets to the Need.  If the demand curve kept going to the right, the equilibrium quantity would be greater than the Need.  Some economists argue that health insurance with no copayment moves the demand curve so far to the right that the equilibrium quantity of services exceeds what people really need.</p>
<p>For an example of how you might use a supply-demand diagram to figure something out, here is a digression about sin taxes, like the cigarette tax ...</p> 
<p><img src="img/sd.gif" height="182" width="183"></p>
<p> You can regard the cigarette tax as increasing the cost
of supplying the
cigarettes. Adding a tax raises the cost per pack by the amount of the
tax. The diagram here shows the effect. The supply curve moves down,
which is to the
left in this diagram. The vertical distance between the old supply
curve (shown in black) and the new supply curve (shown in red) is the
amount of the tax per pack. The equilibrium quantity supplied and
demanded is lower (more to the left).
That is the intended goal of the tax increase.
</p>
<p>If the supply curve has a positive slope ...
<blockquote>so that it's not horizontal =
<br>so that supply is not completely elastic</blockquote>
... then the price increase ... 
<blockquote>(the distance
between the blue and red lines)</blockquote>  
... will be less than the tax increase.</p>
<p>This means that the customers and the sellers will share paying the tax
on each pack bought. </p>
<p>Another digression ...</p>
<p>Why should a supply curve has an upward slope?  In theory, it is because some sellers have higher costs than other sellers, or that individual sellers have some facilities that are more productive than others.  A farmer may have some fields that are better than others.  So might an oil company. At higher prices, the less productive facilities can operate at a profit.  At lower prices, they can't, so they shut down, which means less stuff offered for sale.
When the tax is imposed, some high-cost sellers drop out of the market.
The lower-cost sellers who stay in make less profit.</p>
