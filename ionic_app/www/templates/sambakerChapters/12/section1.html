	<p>No, this is not a strategy guide to the Hasbro conquer-the-world game. Rather, it is a discussion of the concept of risk as used in economics.</p>

	<p>Risk is important to insurance, the evaluation of securities, and really any economic decision involving the future.</p>

	<p><b>Definition:</b> A situation has <b>risk</b> if the future state or outcome of the situation is not known for certain.</p>

	<p>By that definition, most situations involve risk.</p>

	<p>A risky situation can have more than one possible outcome. For each possible outcome (or range of outcomes) one can assess the probability that the particular outcome will happen.</p>

	<p>Frank H. Knight, in his 1921 book <b>Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit</b> made this distinction between what he called "risk" and "uncertainty":</p>

	<p><b>Risk</b> The probabilities of the various possible outcomes are known<br>
	<p><b>Uncertainty</b> The probabilities of the various possible outcomes are not known.</p>

	<p>By that definition, most real-life situations involve uncertainty. You usually don't know the probabilities of the different things that can happen in real life.</p>

	<p>Uncertainty, though, is hard to analyze, so instead we usually assume that we do know the probabilities of all of the outcomes. Games of chance are the situations that come closest to having known probabilities for all outcomes. Insurance, particularly life insurance and property/casualty insurance (for example, insurance against damage from a natural disaster), comes close to having known probabilities, based on past experience with people and nature.</p>

	<p>Securities (stocks and bonds) are often analyzed using the concept of risk. Some "hedge" funds in the mid-1990s developed elaborate strategies for investment that hedged -- counter-balanced -- the risks. The funds bought some securities and simultaeously borrowed ("shorted") related securities when the differences between their prices was strayed from their historical norm. The probability, as they calculated it, of making a profit was a near-certainty. Two economists won a Nobel Prize in 1997 for working out the theory of this. Those economists lent their names and expertise to one hedge fund, which was hugely successful until unexpected events (financial crises in Asian countries in 1997 and then Russia's bond default in 1998) changed the probabilities. Investors, including these economists, got a very expensive reminder that there is uncertainty in securities.  I can't resist showing you this diagram from Wikipedia on "Long Term Capital Management":</p>

	<p>(To be fair to those economists, it appears that the firm, Long Term Capital Management, had taken a long position in Russian bonds, not hedged according to the economists' theory).</p>

	<p>This lesson was pretty much ignored, however. Shortly thereafter, banks and insurance companies greatly expanded trading in securities that were elaborately designed to segregate risks in lending money to buy real estate. When real estate prices, which had been rising since 1998, levelled off in 2006 and fell precipitously in 2007, the probabilities changed dramatically. Many of these mortgage-backed securities became worthless. That included securities with an AAA rating, meaning that they were supposed to have a neglible risk of failure. In 2008, some major financial institutions failed, while others were saved from failure only by the United States government. Risk was revealed as uncertainty again. (And, some prominent economists who write editorials for the <b>Wall Street Journal</b> were revealed as fools again, even though none of them admit it yet.)</p>

	<p>But, as I said, uncertainty is hard to analyze, so let's look at risk.</p>

	<p>Since risk is defined as a situation is which the probabilities of possible outcomes are known, let's spend a moment reviewing the concept of probability.</p>
