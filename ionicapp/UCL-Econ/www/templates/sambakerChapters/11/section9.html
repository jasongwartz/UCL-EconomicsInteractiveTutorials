	<p>Here's the NPV curve for the red line investment for discount rates from 0% to 100%.</p>

	<img src="img/c11-s8-1.gif" width="541" height="245" border="0" alt="NPV equation">

	<p>At discount rates below 0.054, the NPV is negative, and this investment is worse than doing nothing.<br>
	At a discount rate of 0.054, the NPV is 0. The first IRR for this investment is 0.054.<br>
	If the discount rate rises above 0.054, the NPV turns positive, and this investment switches to being profitable.<br>
	At a discount rate of 0.262 (26.2%), the NPV for this investment reaches its maximum. If the discount rate rises further than that, the NPV falls.<br>
	The NPV reaches 0 again at a discount rate of 0.86. This is the second IRR for this investment.<br>
	If the discount rate were rises even more, above 0.86, the NPV turns negative again. This investment reswitches to being unprofitable.</p>

	<h4>Lesson: The NPV curve gives better guidance than the IRR alone</h4>

	<p>The lesson I would like you to get from this is that the internal rate of return, by itself, can fool you.  If the investments you are considering have different shapes (that is, very different timing of costs and benefits) or if the project has large late cleanup costs, then the higher-IRR-is-better rule can steer you to the wrong investment. Ideally, you want the NPV curve, if you want to evaluate an investment.</p>

	<h4>Additional notes</h4>
  
	<blockquote<p>My use of the terms "switch" and "reswitch" refers to the reswitching controversy of the 1960's. This was between economists in Cambridge, England, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, over whether capital markets can be analyzed just like other commodity markets. The English economists, led by Joan Robinson, argued that capital markets were special because of the possibility of reswitching, which raises basic questions about the standard view that the return to owning capital is a society's reward for abstaining from consumption.</p>
	<p>Some economists would say that only the second of our IRR's is the true IRR, by defining the IRR as the place where the NPV is 0 <b>and</b> where the NPV is falling. The problems with that are: (1) this distinction is usually lost in practice, and (2) by making the pattern of costs and profits more complex, I can make up an investment that has multiple discount rates where the NPV is 0 and the NPV is declining.</p></blockquote>
