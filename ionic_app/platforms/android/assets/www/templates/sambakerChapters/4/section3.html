<h1>Demand Graphs</h1>
<p>In textbooks, demand relations are often presented as graphs rather than
tables. Mathematically the two are equivalent. Some people can't stand
graphs, but many others find that graphs are easier to take in at a glance
than tables are. So, for those of you who like graphs, here is that demand
relation graphed:</p>

<p>The points form a line that slopes downward from left to right. Most demand
graphs do this. The downward slope means that at higher prices less is
sold, while at lower prices more is sold.
<p>Each * on the graph corresponds to a price-quantity pair in the table.
This is shown in the graph below by labelling with A through F the points
on the graph and the corresponding columns in the table.</p>

<p>When you change your price, you move along the demand graph from one point
to another.</p>
