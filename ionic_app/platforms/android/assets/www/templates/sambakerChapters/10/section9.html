<p>
The discount rate that zeroes -- approximately -- the total present value is 0.057, or 5.7%.  Being able to buy this bond at a discount made the internal rate of return much higher than this bond's 1% coupon rate.</p>
<p>If a bond is risky, it will sell at a discount like this.  That gives the buyers a bigger return, which rewards them for assuming the risk that the bond will default.  The perceived riskiness determines the size of the discount.</p>

<h2>
Application 2: Detecting an Economic Shortage</h2></center>

Economists use the term <b>economic shortage</b> to mean a situation
in which the quantity supplied of some good or service is less than what
it would be if the market were functioning freely and competitively.  In other words, "economic" shortages or supluses happen when the market fails to equilibrate.

<p>Shortages can manifest themselves two ways. One is with long lines of
buyers and empty store shelves. The other is with prices higher than cost
plus normal profit. (More on "normal profit" later.)</p>
<p>Detecting the first type of shortage is easy -- you just observe the
lines or empty shelves. Detecting the second type is harder.</p>
<p>How do you judge when prices are high? Use the internal rate of return!
We'll illustrate this with our machine investment example.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are two investments available to large numbers of
investors. One is machines that currently pay off like this:</p>

<hr>
<br />
<p>The other is the 5% bank account. </p>
<p>The machine has a higher internal rate
of return, at 5.47%, than the bank's 5%. What happens? Firms like yours
take money out of the bank to buy machines.</p>
