		<h1>
The Internal Rate of Return</h1>
Copyright &copy; 1997-2013 Samuel L. Baker
<p>When you are evaluating an investment, a useful number number to know
is the <b>internal rate of return</b>.
<p>For some investments, like bank accounts, the internal rate of return
is easy to figure because the bank tells you what it is. For example, a
5% simple interest bank account has an internal rate of return of 5%.
<p>For other investments, you have to do some work to calculate the internal
rate of return. This is especially true of investments like building a
factory or getting an education. These kinds of investments generally don't
pay money in nice even amounts like a bank account does. Nevertheless,
you can calculate an internal rate of return for these investments, and
use it to decide which investments pay best.
<p>To evaluate investments and calculate an internal rate of return, we
need the concept of <b>income stream</b>.</p>

<center>
<h3>
Income Stream</h3></center>
In the grubby world of economic theory, where money is everything, any
investment can be expressed as an income stream. An income stream lists
years (or months or whatever) and the amounts of money that flow in or
<h4>
An Income Stream Example</h4>

<p>Here is the income stream for what you get if you
<ol>
<li>Put $1000 in a 5% simple interest bank account
<li>Take out the $50 interest each year.  ($50 is 5% of $1000.)
<li>Take all the money out at the end of the sixth year.
</ol>

In Year 0, which represents Now, we put $1000 in the bank. We put a negative
number, -$1000 in for Income in Year 0, because the $1000 flows out from
us.

In years 1 through 5, we will get paid $50, 5% of $1000. The 50s above
are positive numbers, showing that the money flows to us.
<p>Note: To keep things simple, we imagine that interest is paid annually.
Most real life bank accounts pay interest monthly. Also, we imagine that
we withdraw each year's interest payment from the bank. We don't leave
it in the bank to compound (earn interest on the accumulated interest)
during the following years.

Imagine that at the end of year 6 we take our $1000 back. Our total income
in year 6 is $1050, the $1000 principal plus the $50 interest we get in
year 6. <img src="TwoIncomeStreams.gif" alt="" width="383" height="298" border="0" align="right">
