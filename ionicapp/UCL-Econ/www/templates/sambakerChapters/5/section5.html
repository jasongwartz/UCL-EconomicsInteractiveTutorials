<h1>Managed care and demand elasticity</h1>

<p>Managed care health insurance companies buy service from providers and sell it to patients.
They stand in the market between the providers and the patients. For managed
care companies, patient loyalty to providers is a problem. Managed care
companies prefer that the patients be loyal to them, not to particular
providers. That way the companies can switch providers whenever they want.
Managed care companies want providers' (doctors and hospitals)
demand to be elastic, but their own demand to be inelastic.</p>

<p>This is why managed care companies have been so interested in developing measures
of quality and means of quality control. If a managed care company can
document something that it can credibly call "quality," then providers are more interchangeable.  That makes the providers' demand more elastic.</p>


<h2>Copayments by patients and demand elasticity</h2>

<p>The currently trendy idea in health care finance is high-deductible health insurance.  Under Obamacare, the basic mandated insurance plan is expected to have a deductible around $6000 and a 20% copay above that up to a limit.  
To make this decidedly uncomprehensive insurance more palatable to consumers, 
the Federal government allows Health Savings Accounts, which make some of what consumers spend on health care deductible from taxable income.  </p>
<p>As a gift to the banking industry, this tax deductibility is implemented by employees and employers 
putting money into these accounts, which banks get paid to administer.</p>

<p>Near the top of this tutorial there is a question about how a deductible can make demand more elastic.</p>

<p>Advocates of high-copay insurance this "consumer driven" health care.  
But, really, is the consumer driving?  Or is the consumer being driven?</p>

<p>In pharmaceuticals, for example, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) buys drugs at prices much lower than
what seniors in Medicare Part D are paying.  The difference is because the Medicare drug benefit law 
fragments the buyers, while the V.A. negotiates on behalf of veterans as a group.</p>

<p>The American Medical Association has been advocating Health Savings Accounts for years.  
The advantage from their point of view is that each patient negotiates with the provider as an individual.  
There is no group buying power.</p>
