Monopoly Price and Output</h1>
Copyright &copy; 1985-2001 Samuel L. Baker
<h6>Formerly at hspm.sph.sc.edu/ECON/Monopoly/Mon.html</h6>

<p>This tutorial shows how, in theory, a business firm that monopolizes
its industry finds the price and output rate that maximize profit.
<p>A "monopoly," in economics jargon, is the sole seller of its product.&nbsp;
The way this is represented mathematically is to give the firm a downward
sloping demand curve.&nbsp; This means that a monopoly is a firm whose
demand is not perfectly elastic.&nbsp; The monopolist can change the price,
and the result is that the amount sold changes.&nbsp; This is contrast
to a competitive firm, which must sell at the going price, take it or leave
it, but can sell an unlimited amount of product at that price.
<p>The monopolist is a "price maker," not a "price taker."
<p>This may seem like a too broad a definition of monopoly.&nbsp; Is Wendy's,
the fast food chain, a monopoly?&nbsp; Their demand is not perfectly elastic
-- they can raise their prices without having the quantity demanded drop
to zero. That makes them a monopoly, yes?

<p>Both answers are correct.&nbsp; Wendy's is not a monopolist, in any
sense that would get it in trouble with the law, but it is the only seller
of its particular brands and formulations.&nbsp; Economists call this kind
of market "monopolistic competition," a term coined by economist Joan Robinson.&nbsp;
Each firm that sells fast food has a demand curve with some slope; they
can sell more by lowering their prices, or sell less by raising their prices.&nbsp;
This means that the monopoly analysis can be applied.&nbsp; But the demand
curve is not very inelastic, so no great excess profits can be made, because
other firms' fast food can nearly substitute for Wendy's.

<p>Is the distinction between monopolistic competition and monopoly clear
to you?
<br><applet CODE="Mon015.class" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN="TOP"></applet>
<p>Most businesses we encounter in the course of a day are considered monopolistic
competitors.&nbsp; They are in markets that have <b>product differentiation</b>,
meaning that buyers can tell the difference between one seller's version
of the product and another seller's version. The seller's market power
is limited, however.&nbsp; In monopolistic competition, no great public
harm results if one seller raises price above the competitive level.
<p>Medical practices, for example, have product differentiation.&nbsp;
People recognize differences among doctors, even though the differences
are often a matter of style, and not of measurable quality.&nbsp; A physician's
demand is usually not completely elastic.
<p>The line between monopoly and monopolistic competition is a matter of
debate.&nbsp; Antitrust cases can turn on where the judge puts the distinction.&nbsp;
The issue is typically phrased in terms of what market is.  For example,
in the aluminum antitrust case of 1946, the Aluminum Company of America
(ALCOA) argued that its market was metals, and that its aluminum competed
with steel in the monopolistic competition sense.&nbsp; The judge decided
that aluminum was different enough from other metals to be a market of
its own, and that ALCOA had a near-monopoly of that market, which it did
in those days, selling 90% of new aluminum in North America.  (ALCOA also argued that 
the market should include scrap aluminum, as well as new aluminum.  The judge 
rejected that, too, on the grounds that all the scrap aluminum used to be new.)  
<p>One possible distinction would be by the elasticity of demand at a competitive
price level.&nbsp; I might say that monopolistic competition is characterized
by elastic demand at competitive price levels, while monopolists have inelastic
demand at competitive price levels.&nbsp; By "competitive price level,"
I mean what the price would be if the market were competitive.&nbsp; This
qualifying phrase has to be added because an unrestrained profit-maximizing
monopoly will raise its price to where its demand is elastic, as the following
analysis shows.&nbsp; That is why, to use elasticity of demand as a criterion,
you have to ascertain what the price would be if the market were competitive.
<p>This next section of the tutorial shows how monopoly (or monopolistic
competition) pricing decisions can be analyzed.&nbsp; The analysis is based
on the assumption that the firm seeks to maximize its profit.&nbsp; Real-life
firms can have other goals.&nbsp; This analysis shows what is theoretically
possible.&nbsp; It leads to the diagram, that you can find in almost any
introductory economics textbook, that shows a demand curve, a marginal
revenue curve, and a marginal cost curve.&nbsp; The profit-maximizing output
rate is where the marginal revenue curve and the marginal cost curve intersect.
<h2>
Marginal Revenue</h2>
The concept we'll need to analyze monopoly pricing and output decisions
is "marginal revenue."&nbsp; We'll develop the marginal revenue concept
with some numerical examples.
<h3>
Marginal Revenue Defined</h3>
Marginal revenue is defined as the addition to total revenue that comes
increasing by one unit the rate at which you sell your product or service.
<p>You might think that the additional revenue you'd get from selling one
more unit per day (or whatever time period you want) would just be the
price at which you sell the extra unit.&nbsp; That's true if you are a
price-taker, but not if you are a price-maker.
<p>If you are a price-taker, and you want to sell one more unit per day,
you just sell it.&nbsp; Your demand is elastic and the market will take
all you want at the going price.
<p>If you are a price-maker, and you want to sell one more unit per day,
you must lower your price.&nbsp; This makes the calculation of how much
revenue you gain more complex.&nbsp; You get some additional revenue by
increasing the rate of your sales, but you also lose some revenue because
you are getting less money for each item sold.&nbsp; For this reason, your
marginal revenue less than your price.&nbsp; It is even possible for the
marginal revenue to be negative.&nbsp; This happens if what you lose from
lowering the per-item price is more than what you gain from selling additional
items.
<p>Not yet clear?&nbsp; Don't worry.&nbsp; Let's go through an illustration.&nbsp;
We start with the simpler case, the case of the price-taking firm.
<h3>
Marginal Revenue in the Price Taker (Horizontal Demand Curve) Case</h3>
Imagine that you run a primary care clinic.&nbsp; Your "product" is visits.&nbsp;
If there is stiff price competition among clinics in your area, your demand
may look something like this:
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20

Quantity of visits demanded per hour:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9
</pre>
This is a peculiar demand table.&nbsp; All the numbers in the price row
are $20!&nbsp; What about higher and lower prices?&nbsp; At prices above
$20, you sell nothing.&nbsp; At prices below $20, you can sell as much
as you want, but you'd just be throwing
<br>money away, because you can sell as much as you want at $20.&nbsp;
Such a demand table is characteristic of "competitive" markets in which
no one firm can influence the price.
<p>Here's that demand table translated into a graph.&nbsp; Every price-quantity
pair in the table corresponds to a point "*" on the graph.

The points "*" form a horizontal line, which is why this is called a horizontal
demand curve.
<p>If our quantities were in hundreds or thousands, then instead of ten
discreet points, we'd have a horizontal line.

</pre>
<h3>
Total Revenue</h3>
As a first step towards calculating the marginal revenue, let's calculate
the total revenue at each output rate.
<p><b>Definition:&nbsp; Total Revenue = Price times Quantity.</b>
<p>More precisely, Total Revenue, in dollars per hour, equals the Price
of each unit multiplied by the number of units sold per hour. (The time
period doesn't have to be hours; it can be days or years or any unit of
time.&nbsp; The currency unit doesn't have to be dollars; it can be any
form of money.)
<p>Let's calculate some Total Revenue numbers for this price-taking firm.&nbsp;
Click on a text field below (the little boxes are called "text fields")
and type in the Total Revenue for that output rate. Type a plain number
with no $ sign. Press Enter and I'll tell you if you were right.

<h3>
Marginal Revenue for Price-Taking Firm</h3>
The marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from going from one
output rate to the next.&nbsp; In the applet below, click on a text field
and type in the appropriate marginal revenue. (Type a plain number with
no $ sign.)
<br>Press Enter and I'll tell you if the number you typed was right.

<hr color="#ff0000" size="2">
<br><p>Pretty boring, huh?&nbsp; All the marginal revenues are the same.&nbsp;
The confirms that, for the price taking firm, marginal revenue equals the
going price, which is $20 per visit in this example.
<p>Let's see this on a graph:
<h4>
Demand and Marginal Revenue -- Price Taker Firm</h4>
The&nbsp; m's&nbsp; on the graph show marginal revenue.&nbsp; The first&nbsp;
m&nbsp; on the left,
<br>for example, means that the marginal revenue from increasing sales
from
<br>0 visits per hour to 1 is $20.
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * = Demand Curve Points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m = Marginal Revenue Curve Points

</pre>
If there were a very large number of points, instead of just the 10 discrete
output levels we have here, the points would blend together into smooth
lines.&nbsp; The demand curve and the marginal revenue curve would coincide.
<p>To sum up: If the price is fixed by the
<br>market or by government, and demand is elastic (you can sell all you
want at the going price) then
<br>marginal revenue = the price.
<p>Let's look at the Total and Marginal Revenues again.
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20
Quantity of visits demanded per hour:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9
Total Revenue per hour (=Price times Quantity):
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 180
Marginal Revenue (= difference in Total Revenue)
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20
</pre>
The preceding interactive tutorial said that the marginal decision rule
for setting output rate for the competitive firm was: Increase the output
rate so long the price received is greater than the marginal cost.
<p>We can now restate the marginal decision rule more generally: Expand
production so long as marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost.
<p>To reiterate the explanation: The marginal revenue is what you gain
if you sell one more visit. The marginal cost is what it costs if you sell
one more visit. If selling one more visit per hour gains you more than
it costs, a "rational" decision maker sells one more visit.
<p>Let's add a (made-up) marginal cost line to the table.<a NAME="table for applet 04"></a>
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20

<h3>
A Price Maker's Demand Curve</h3>
Now we're ready to compare the price maker situation. To do this, we just
give the firm's demand curve a downward slope. Now our firm is no longer
a passive price taker. It can choose what price to charge. Sales go down
if the price goes up, and vice-versa.
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEMAND TABLE -- Price Maker (Monopoly)

Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10

Quantity of visits demanded per hour:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9
</pre>
In economic theory, any price maker is, is effect, a monopolist. Suppose
yours is the only clinic in your area. You don't have to charge the going
price because there is no going price. You can charge what you want, but
what you charge determines how many visits you get. To get more patients
you must charge less. Raise your price, and you get fewer patients. Your
happy problem is to jack up the price to the optimal level. You can find
the optimal level by using the marginal decision rule. To do this you must
calculate the marginal revenue. But first, let's see a graph of this demand
table.
<p>Here's the demand table translated into a graph. Each price-quantity
pair in the table corresponds to a point "*" on the graph.

</pre>
The points "*" form a descending line in this price maker case.
<p>Before we go further I need to point out a crucial hidden assumption,
namely that at any given price, you sell as much as people will buy at
that price.
<p>In reality, most businesses decide both the prices they want to charge
and the quantities they'll produce for sale. For example, here you could
decide to charge $40 per visit, but only see 3 patients per hour. There
would be excess demand, because at that price people would want 6 visits,
but you could turn the extras away or make them wait.
<p>The crucial assumption is that you do not turn sales away. Instead you
always charge what the market will bear. If you want 3 visits, you charge
no less than $70 each. If you want to charge $40 you expand your capacity
to accommodate the demanded quantity, which is 6.
<p>This implies, for example, that if you are providing 4 visits per hour,
you must be charging what price? (Here's the demand table again, for reference.)
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10
Quantity of visits demanded per hour:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9

<h4>
Price-Maker's (Monopolist's) Total Revenue</h4>
The first step to getting marginal revenue is getting total revenue, as
before.&nbsp; The total revenues form a pattern I'd like you to notice,
so please fill in the blanks in this table:

<hr color="#ff0000" size="2">
<br><p>In the monopoly case, total revenue goes up and then goes down, as the
output rate rises. This is unlike the competitive firm, for which the total
revenue goes up linearly as the output rate rises.&nbsp; That's because
you have to charge lower and lower prices to sell more and more.
<p>Let's bring in the elasticity concept. Elasticity is discussed in <a href="../Elast/Elast.html">an
another interactive tutorial</a>. We'll use "elastic" here to mean that
the elasticity of demand has an absolute value greater than 1. We'll use
"inelastic" here to mean that the elasticity of demand has an absolute
value between 0 and 1. ("Absolute value" means changing negative numbers
to positive.)
<p>Here again is a table showing prices, quantities, and total revenue.
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10
Quantity of visits demanded per hour:

At high prices, a monopolist's demand is elastic, responsive to price changes.&nbsp;
At low prices, a monopolist's demand is inelastic, not very responsive
to price changes.&nbsp; In practice, what is a "low price" and what is
a "high price" depend on consumers' budgets and on the prices of other
things consumers can buy to help meet their need for this firm's product.
<p>Here is an animated display of the relationship between price and total
revenue.
<br>This diagram has a continuous-looking demand curve, unlike the discreet
demand relation shown in the table above. Imagine for now that we are a
large organization, so that each unit of quantity in the table above actually
represents a large number of visits, so that fractional numbers of visits
make sense.
<br><applet CODE="AnimatedTR.class" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="300" ALIGN="TOP"></applet>
<br>If we had no costs, and all we cared about was maximizing revenue,
then we would set the price at $50. We would see 5 patients per hour, and
make $250 per hour.
<h3>
A Monopolist's Marginal Revenue</h3>
The marginal revenue is the change in total revenue resulting from a change
of one unit in the output rate.&nbsp; In the bottom row of the applet below,
click on a text field and type in the appropriate marginal revenue. (As
always, type a plain number with no $ sign.) Press Enter and I'll tell
you if that marginal revenue is right. To be sure you see the pattern,
I'll be asking you do fill in most of the text fields on the bottom row.

<br><p>Marginal revenue goes down as the quantity you try to sell increases.
If, as here, the demand curve is inelastic in some price range, the marginal
revenue is negative in that price range.&nbsp; Negative marginal revenue
means that you lose revenue if you lower price and expand sales.&nbsp;
A negative marginal revenue implies that if you reverse you price cuts
and raise prices, your sales shrink but your total revenue goes up.
<p>In view of that, try this True-False question:

<br>Uwe Reinhardt, in "Perspective: Our Obsessive Quest to Gut the Hospital,"
<i>Health Affairs</i>, Summer 1996, <i>15</i>(2), pp. 145-154, argues that
hospitals should allocate more of their overhead costs to services whose
demand is inelastic, and allocate less overhead costs to services whose
demand is elastic. In effect, he is applying this principle, that the monopolist
gains revenue by raising price where demand is inelastic.
<p>Here's a graph showing our demand and marginal revenue numbers.&nbsp;
This graph shows the first and fourth lines of the table that you filled
in above.&nbsp; (Scroll up about one full screen to see it.)
<br>In this graph, the points on the demand line are *'s; the points on
the marginal revenue line are m's.

The marginal revenues lie below the demand points, and fall twice as fast.&nbsp;
The m's go negative when the quantity demanded is above 5, which happens
when the price drops below $50.

<h3>
Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, and the Profit-Maximizing Output Rate</h3>
Now let's go back to our table and add marginal costs to it: (The table
is getting big!)
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10

</pre>
To save space, I didn't include a row for Total Cost.&nbsp; We don't need
that to calculate the profit-maximizing output rate.&nbsp; All we need
is the marginal revenue, marginal cost, and the <b>restated marginal decision
rule:&nbsp; Expand output so long as the marginal revenue is greater than
the marginal cost.</b>
<br>What is our profit-maximizing output rate?

<br><p>Notice that, at 4 visits, we are in the elastic portion of the demand
curve.&nbsp; We don't just raise our price so long as the demand is inelastic.&nbsp;
We cut back even more than that, so as to give us the biggest profit above
our costs.
<p>The monopolist allows 4 visits and charges $60 for each. A competitive
industry with the same costs and demand would, as we saw earlier, have
7 visits and charge $30 each.
<h3>
What's So Bad About Monopoly?</h3>
With monopoly, there's an allocation and a distribution issue.&nbsp; The
distribution issue is easier to see:&nbsp; The monopolist raises the price.&nbsp;
This redistributes income from the costomers to the monopolist. That would
be a sufficient complaint for most of us, but not for orthodox economists,
who insist on not making value judgements about which people are more deserving
of income.
<p>Economists tend to emphasize the allocation issue, which we can illustrate
with our example.
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10

Marginal Revenue
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -70
Marginal Cost

</pre>
The profit-maximizing monopolist sets the price at $60 and has four visits
per hour.&nbsp; Somewhere out there, though, is a 5th person who would
come in if the price were $50.&nbsp; (We know this because the first two
rows tell us that if we charge $50 we can sell 5 visits per hour.)&nbsp;
That visit must therefore be worth at least $50 to that person.&nbsp; The
marginal cost of providing that visit is $15.&nbsp; (The fourth row of
numbers tells us that.)&nbsp; By not providing 5 visits, we are giving
up an opportunity to turn $15 worth of resources into $50 worth of service.&nbsp;
That's a net loss to society of $35.&nbsp; We are not using our resources
in the best possible way.
<p>This is called a "consumer surplus" argument, and we can make it again
with the 6th and 7th visits.&nbsp; By not providing that 6th visit, we
are failing to turn $15 worth of resources into $40 worth of service.&nbsp;
By not providing the 7th visit, we are failing to turn $15 worth of resources
(the marginal cost of the 7th visit) into $30 worth of service.
<p>A competitive market would provide the 5th, 6th, and 7th visits.&nbsp;
If somebody could enter our market, they could make money providing those
visits, because the prices they could get would exceed the marginal costs.&nbsp;
A competitive market would stop at 7, because the 8th visit has a marginal
cost higher than the price you get get for it.&nbsp; Still, that's a lot
more than the 4 visits that the monopoly finds profit-maximizing.
<h3>
Summary</h3>
Marginal revenue is the change in revenue that results from a unit change
in the amount sold.&nbsp; The marginal revenue curve can be mathematically
derived from the demand curve.
<p>Monopolies (or any firms with downward-sloping, non-perfectly-elastic,
demand curves) maximizing their profit by raising price and reducing output
so long as the demand is inelastic.&nbsp; Then they raise the price even
more, until the marginal revenue lost from the reduction in sales is greater
than the marginal cost saved thanks to a lower rate of operation.
<p>The monopoly's high price transfers income from customers to the monopolist.&nbsp;
The monopoly's low output rate wastes social resources, by not turning
some resources into products that would be valued more highly than the
resources are.
<h3>
Comment</h3>
Monopolies cause other problems, too.&nbsp; They can have higher costs
than necessary, taking their monopoly profits in the form of extra costs.&nbsp;
Monopolies can ignore opportunities to innovate in their own industries.&nbsp;
They can aggressively stifle innovation in related industries if they see
a threat to their existing monopoly.  All these issues go beyond the price theory that this tutorial is about, and may be more important.
