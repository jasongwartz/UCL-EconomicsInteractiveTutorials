<h3>Competitive conditions worsen</h3>
Let us imagine that new competitors
enter the market. Why might they do this? Because there is profit to be made
in this industry. Joan's is making $4900 a year. Others can figure that
out, and start their own companies just like Joan's.
<p>The result is that supply expands for the whole industry. If the industry
demand curve doesn't change, the equilibrium price will fall. 
<ul class="sub"><li>In a market
where the government sets the price, this won't happen automatically,
but the government may catch on that it can cut the price and still get the service provided.  This happened after the Affordable Care Act cut the payment that the government was making to Medicare Advantage (Medicare managed care) plans.</ul>
<p>Suppose the price in Joan's market falls to $3300. How many patients does Joan's serve
now? We'll figure this out by starting where we are now (at 7 patients per year) and using the marginal
decision rule. 
<p>Here are the relevant lines in the cost table:

<table CELLSPACING=5 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>Number of Patients
<br><b>n</b></td>

<td>Total Cost
<br>of <b>n</b> patients</td>

<td>Marginal Cost
<br>of the <b>n</b>th patient</td>
</tr>

<tr ALIGN=RIGHT>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>6</td>

<td>$17500</td>

<td>$3000</td>
</tr>

<tr ALIGN=RIGHT>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>7</td>

<td>$21000</td>

<td>$3500</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="question">Should Joan's continue to serve 7 patients, if the price is $3300?
<br>
<input type="radio" name="MC8" value="yes">Yes.</input>
<input type="radio" name="MC8" value="no">No.</input>
<div id="MC8-answers"></div>

<p>If the going price drops from $3700 to $3300, the old output rate of 7 is too high, if we want the greatest profit.  Let's look at one line up in the Joan's cost table.</p>
<table CELLSPACING=5 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>Number of Patients
<br><b>n</b></td>

<td>Total Cost
<br>of <b>n</b> patients</td>

<td>Marginal Cost
<br>of the <b>n</b>th patient</td>
</tr>

<tr ALIGN=RIGHT>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>5</td>

<td>$14500</td>

<td>$2500</td>
</tr>

<tr ALIGN=RIGHT>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>6</td>

<td>$17500</td>

<td>$3000</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>How about 6? Should Joan's serve 6 patients if the price is $3300?
<br>
<input type="radio" name="MC9" value="yes">Yes.</input>
<input type="radio" name="MC9" value="no">No.</input>
<div id="MC9-answers"></div>
<div id="MC9A-answer">

<p>&uArr;
<p>&uArr;
<p>&uArr;
<p>&uArr;
</div>
<p>We now have the new profit-maximizing output rate.
<p>Let's figure out how much profit Joan's makes now:
<p>Total revenue is 6 times $3300, which equals $19800.
<p>Total cost from the table above is $17500.
<p>Profit is $19800 - $17500 = $2300.
<p>This is less profit than before, but it's the most Joan's can make at the current price.
