<h1>Cost Concepts</h1>

<p>
We'll use for illustration an imaginary firm, Joan's
Home Care Services,
which uses nurses, supplies, and machinery to maintain patients with a
certain ailment. As a starting point, we assume that Joan's already
knows
what their total cost would be for maintaining any number of patients
for
a year.
</p>
<p>In practice, developing that cost information requires considerable
work. We assume that this work has been done.
</p>
<h2>Total, Fixed, and Variable Cost</h2>
<blockquote>
  <strong>Total Cost</strong><br />
  is what it costs to operate at some particular rate of output.<br /><br />
  <strong>Total Cost</strong> is not the cost per item. That's the average cost, which we'll discuss in another tutorial.<br />

Total cost is a flow.  It is always over a certain period of time.  If you're talking about, say, the total cost of 100 trauma patients in an emergency department, have in mind that you are really talking about the total cost of 100 trauma patients in a month, or whatever time period you want.<br />
Total cost can be divided into two portions: Fixed Cost and Variable Cost.
</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Fixed Cost</strong><br />
  Fixed Cost is the part of the budget that stays the same regardless of
whether you produce a lot, a little bit, or even if you produce zero.
Overhead, rent on buildings, and interest on loans are in fixed cost.</blockquote>
  <blockquote><strong>Variable Cost</strong><br />
  is the rest of total cost, the part that varies as you produce
more or less. Producing more adds to Variable Cost. Producing less reduces it.</blockquote>
<p>
For those of you who like graphs, here is a graph
illustrating total, variable, and fixed cost for Joan's Home Care. In
this tutorial, we will be working with the numbers in this graph.</p>

<p>
Which costs are fixed and which costs are variable depends on your time horizon. 
In what economists call the "short run," labor cost (staffing) might be fixed. 
A lab may have a certain number of technicians, for example.
From day to day, its cost for materials might vary, depending on how
many tests it does, but the labor cost is fixed. In the "longer run," labor
costs might be variable, as the lab adjusts staffing to the demand for
its tests, but costs for its facility (space and major equipment) would
be fixed. 
In the "long run," the lab can change its space and equipment.
No costs would be fixed in the long run.
<p>For Joan's, we'll imagine an intermediate run, where labor and
materials are variable costs, but overhead is not. (The cost numbers in the
following tables are made up for illustrative purpose. They are not represented
as realistic.)
</p>
<p>
Suppose that Joan's has done its accounting work, and
has come up with these
figures for what it costs Joan's Home Care to maintain various numbers
of patients for a year. (Assume that patients sign one year contracts,
so we don't have to bother with fractions of patients. This makes
things
simpler.)

In practice, a firm would probably proceed in the reverse order from
the way we did. It would understand that total cost is made up of fixed
cost and variable cost. It would figure out what its fixed cost is and
what its variable costs are at different rates of output. Then it would
add the fixed and variable cost to get the total cost.
