Government Insurance</h3>
What is the nature of the risk you face when you buy insurance?&nbsp; Economists
often regard risks like those of having to pay big medical bills as simply
part of life.&nbsp; But in a country with a stable government and economy,
the risks for which we must buy insurance are the risks that the government
chooses not to cover.
<p>The risk of illness and death is part of the nature of life.&nbsp; However,
the risks of financial loss, or of needing medical care that one cannot
finance oneself, these risks are socially determined.
<p>We can and do buy health insurance for which our expected loss is 10%
of what we pay.&nbsp; If the cost of operating the insurance system could
be reduced to 5% of premiums or less, we could afford to buy more insurance,
and get more peace of mind.&nbsp; Or we could just pocket the difference
in cost.&nbsp; Cost and profit shares below about 10% are hard to achieve
in private insurance companies, because private insurance must be sold
and premiums collected.&nbsp; This requires a sales force, office staff,
and equipment.
<p>In the U.S., Medicare, which serves the elderly nearly universally,
has administrative costs below 5% of what it pays out.&nbsp; Medicare piggy-backs
on the Internal Revenue Service's tax collection operation for collecting
its premiums.&nbsp; No one has to be sold on Medicare, and Medicare doesn't
need its own premium-collecting system.&nbsp; That saves money.
<p>Other countries' national health insurance or national health services
save even more through the financing simplification that universal coverage
makes possible.&nbsp; In Canada, hospitals do not have to generate bills,
and the government insurance does not have to process them, nor do individuals
have to deal with the paperwork.&nbsp; (The main exceptions are vistors
from the U.S.)&nbsp; Instead, hospitals are paid by global operating and
capital budgets, essentially a lump sum each year.
<p>This makes a public system more efficient.&nbsp; The "house" can take
a smaller percentrage.&nbsp; People can cover more risks for less cost.&nbsp;
That's part of why Canada's system, which covers everybody there, costs
less than the U.S. system.&nbsp; Competition among private firms can reduce
some costs, but not the costs of competition itself.&nbsp; Our private
market can't get to that level of efficiency by itself.&nbsp; It'll take
legislative action.
