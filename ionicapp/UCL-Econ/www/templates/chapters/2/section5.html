<h3>The Effect of Entry</h3>
<p>As each firm, assuming they are all like Joan's, cuts back on the number
of patients it takes, the total industry supply will shrink and the price
may go part way back up.
<p>At a price of $3300 or more, there will still be profit to be made in this business.  This will attract more firms to enter the market.
<p>As the new firms enter, supply will expand some more and the price will fall again.
​
<p>Here is part of the cost table:

<p>Joan's total revenue is now 5 times $2900, which equals $14500.  Her total cost at 5 is in the table above.
<p>How much profit is Joan's making now?

<p>Joan is not too happy now, unless she is paying herself handsomely 
out of overhead (fixed cost), as Sarah Palin does with her Super PAC.
<p>Unless there is profit like that masquerading as cost, the
incentive to enter this industry is gone. No more firms would enter, so
the price would stop falling.
<p>At this point, competition has forced the price down to
its minimum. All excess profit is squeezed out. The firms have been forced to be just the right size to minimize cost.
The customer gets the most possible value
per dollar spent.
<ul><li>This example works as it does because 
there are diminishing returns to scale at higher output rates.
Joan's marginal cost rises when her output rate is above 5.  If Joan's costs fell as her firm got bigger,
competition would force her firm to grow and grow.
</ul>
<p>Getting back the circumstance we have, what can Joan's do about her $0 profit? One possibility is to innovate, to change how she
operates. She can hire cheaper personnel, lowering marginal cost but raising
fixed cost due to the need for more supervision.
<p>Joan's can also buy new equipment that allows the visiting nurse or
technician to tend to each patient in less time. This also lowers marginal
cost but raises fixed cost.
<p>With less qualified personnel spending less time with each patient,
Joan's may hire a think tank to do a study showing that her quality is not
significantly worse than before and may be better in some ways. The study's
cost add to fixed cost, but may help stimulate some demand.
<p>Here's Joan's new cost table. Fixed cost is higher. Marginal cost is
generally lower than before.

<p class="question">Now how many patients does Joan's serve if the price is $2900?

<p>Joan's is making profit again. This starts the competition cycle again,
though, as other firms enter the market and start driving prices down again.
<p>We're almost done. Just one more point to make.
