		<h1>Perils of the Internal Rate of Return</h1>

    <p>Copyright &copy; 2000 Samuel L. Baker</p>

    <p>The two most-used measures for evaluating an investment are the <b>net present value</b> and the <b>internal rate of return</b>. (Two earlier tutorials discussed these concepts. See the <a href="#home">tutorials list</a> for links to tutorials for discounting future income and the internal rate of return.)</p>

    <p>It is often assumed that higher is better for both of the net present value and the internal rate of return. In particular, it is usually stated that investments with higher internal rates of return are more profitable than investments with lower internal rates of return.</p>

    <p>However, this is not necessarily so. In some situations, an investment with a lower internal rate of return may be better, even judged on narrow financial grounds, than an investment with a higher internal rate of return. This interactive lecture explores why and when this reversal takes place.</p>

    <p>To review, both the net present value and the internal rate of return require the idea of an income stream, so let's start there. An <b>income stream</b> is a series of amounts of money. Each amount of money comes in or goes out at some specific time, either now or in the future. The income stream represents the investment; the income stream is all you need to know for financial evaluation purposes.</p>

    <blockquote>In real life, individuals, charitable institutions, and even for-profit businesses have social or other goals when selecting investments. For businesses, the benefits of community good will are no less real for being difficult to measure precisely. For enterprises with social as well as financial goals, the measures discussed here are still useful: They tell you how much it costs you to advance your social goals.</blockquote>

    <p>Here is an income stream example, from the interactive lecture about the <a href="#sambakerChapterschapter10section1">internal rate of return</a>.</p>

    <div class="tborders">
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Year</td>
        <td>0</td>    
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>6</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Income amounts</td>
        <td>-£1000</td>    
        <td>£200</td>
        <td>£200</td>
        <td>£200</td>
        <td>£200</td>
        <td>£200</td>
        <td>£200</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </div>

  <br><p>Here we see seven points in time and, for each, a dollar inflow or outflow. At year 0 (now), the income amount is negative. Negative income is cost, or outgo.  In this example, the negative income amount in year 0 represents the cost of buying and installing the machine.</p>

  <p>In the future, at years 1 through 6, there will be net income of £200 each year.</p>

  <p>All of the amounts in the income stream are <b>net</b> income, meaning that each is income minus outgo, or revenue minus cost. In year 0, the cost exceeds the revenue by £1000. In years 1 though 6, the revenue will exceed the cost by £200.</p>

  <p>This investment evidently has no salvage value. That is, there is nothing that can be sold in year 6, the last year. If there were, the amount that could be realized from the sale would be added to the income amount for year 6.</p>

  <p>For simplicity, all my examples have the incomes and outgoes at one-year intervals. Real-life investments can have income and expenses at irregular times, but the principles of evaluation are the same.</p>

  <p>Now let's discuss our two measures in connection with this income stream:</p>
