<h3>
Average cost example</h3>
Imagine that you have a toy factory.  
Your an annual fixed cost is $10000.  This fixed cost covers loan interest, utilities, property taxes, etc. 
Suppose the marginal cost of producing each toy is $1.  This is labor and materials.
<blockquote>If you need it, there is a <a href="http://sambaker.com/econ/cost/cost.html">tutorial that explains marginal cost.</a></blockquote>
What is the average cost per toy if you make just 1 toy a year?
<br />
<input id="AC1-response" name="AC1" type="text"></input>
<button id="AC1-button">Type a number in the box.  Then click this.</button>
<div id="AC1-answer">Do not type a $ sign or a comma with your number.  (Sorry!)
<br />If you need a hint, just click the button.</div>

Assume that you can make any number of toys at the same $1 marginal cost per toy.
What is the average cost per year of producing 2 toys
per year?
<br />
<input id="AC2-response" name="AC2" type="text"></input>
<button id="AC2-button">Type a number in the box.  Then click this.</button>
<div id="AC2-answer">Do not type a $ sign or a comma with your number.  (Sorry!)
<br />If you need a hint, just click the button.</div>
It's easy to confuse average cost with marginal cost. Marginal cost
is the cost of adding or subtracting one unit of output.

The average cost includes a portion of the fixed cost, as well as variable
cost. The marginal cost includes only variable cost.
Suppose someone asks, "What is the cost of producing a toy?"  He or she might want the average cost or he or she might want the marginal cost.  You have to guess which from the context of the question.
