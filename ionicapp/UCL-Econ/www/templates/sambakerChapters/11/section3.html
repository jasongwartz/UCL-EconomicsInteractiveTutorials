		<h4>Varying future interest rates</h4>
The future interest rate does not have to be constant for this theory to apply.  The interest rate can vary, but 
that makes the formulas messier.
For example, if r<span class="sub">1</span> is the expected interest rate next year, and r<span class="sub">2</span> is the expected interest rate the year after that, 
then the present value today of I<span class="sub">2</span> income in year 2 is<br>I<span class="sub">2</span>/(1+r<span class="sub">1</span>)(1+r<span class="sub">2</span>).

The<b><i> I</i></b> 's are income amounts for each year. The subscripts
(which are also the exponents in the denominators) are the year numbers,
starting with 0, which is this year. The discount rate -- assumed to
be constant in the future -- is <i>r</i>. The number of years the investment lasts is <i>n</i>.

<p>Three properties of the net present value of an income stream are: </p>
<blockquote>1. Higher income amounts make the net present value higher.  
Lower income amounts make the net present value lower.</blockquote>

Edit the number there, deleting or adding some digits.  Then press Enter.</font>

<font size="-1">The NPV box on the right shows the net present value, which
is the total of the amounts in the boxes in the Discounted row.  (The
total may be slightly off, due to rounding.)</font> 
<blockquote>2. If profits come sooner, the net present value is higher.  
If profits come later, the net present value is lower.</blockquote>
 <font size="-1">Try it yourself. This applet lets you move the income amounts 
to later or earlier. You can see how that changes the net present value of
the income stream.</font> <br>

<blockquote>3. Changing the discount rate changes the net present value.  
For an investment with the common pattern of having costs early and profits 
later, a higher discount rate makes the net present value smaller.</blockquote>
 <font size="-1">Try it yourself. Click on the discount rate box and change 
the number there. Then press Enter.</font> <br>
<font size="-1">You can also change the income amounts, if you want.</font>

To summarize what was just illustrated, the net present value is higher if
the income amounts are larger, or if they come sooner, or if the discount 
rate is lower.  The net present value is lower if the income amounts 
are smaller, or if they come later, or if the discount rate is higher.
