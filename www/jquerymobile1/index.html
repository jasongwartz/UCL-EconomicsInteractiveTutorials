              <h1>Economics Interactive Tutorial:  Marginal Cost and the Optimal Output Rate</h1>
            </div>
          </div>

        <p>This tutorial shows how, in theory, a business firm in a competitive
industry can use the marginal cost concept developed in the previous tutorial
to decide how much to produce and sell.
<p>The big idea:  A <b>marginal decision rule</b> applies to firms in competitive industries.
<ul><li></a>A "competitive industry," in economics jargon, is an industry in which
each firm must sell at the going price, take it or leave it. In the economist's
theoretical idea of a competitive industry, there are so many firms that
the market price does not go up if any one firm sells less output, nor
does the price go down if the one firm sells more output. Farming is a
good example.</ul>
<p>The marginal decision rule theory also applies to any firm that is a "price taker," not a "price maker."
<ul><li></a>A health care provider is a "price taker" if it must sell its services at a price fixed
by the government, or other major payor.  For example, a hospital that takes Medicare patients has to take the price that the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sets.  All the hospital can do is decide how much service capacity to have.</ul>
<p>The marginal decision rule theory assumes that the firm's only goal is maximum profit. A health
care organization with a community service orientation has other goals,
but we ignore them for the time being.
<p>We'll be working again with the imaginary Joan's Home Care Co., using
the same cost numbers as in the preceding tutorial. We'll assume that Joan's
is a price taker, so the only decision to be made is how many patients
to treat per year, based on whatever the going price is.
<h2>
The Marginal Decision Rule</h2>
The marginal decision rule is:
<p><b>Expand production if and only if the price is greater than the marginal
cost.</b>
<p>The idea here is simple, once you get used to the jargon. Increasing
production makes both total cost and total revenue go up. If the revenue
goes up more than the cost, profit goes up. (Profit = total revenue - total
cost.) Marginal cost is how much cost goes up from making one more. The
price is how much revenue goes up from selling one more. (This is where
the price-taker assumption comes in -- you don't have to cut your price
to sell more.) If the price is bigger than the marginal cost, then what
you gain in revenue is greater than what you lose in added cost. That makes
your profit higher, so you should go ahead and expand production.
<p>On the other hand, if price is less than marginal cost, increasing production
costs you more than the revenue you gain. You should not expand production.
<p>Let's see how this works. Here is Joan's cost table, showing the total
cost and the marginal cost for each number of patients. Assume as before
that patients sign one year contracts, so we don't have to bother with
fractions of patients.
