<h1>Demand</h1>
<p>This tutorial introduces the concept of demand. We'll include some numerical
examples to give you practice in interpreting demand charts and graphs.</p>
<p>Let's start with a definition.</p>

<blockquote><h2>ECONOMICS DEFINITION OF DEMAND</h2>
<p>"Demand" is the relationship between the price that is charged and the
amount that will be bought at that price.</p></blockquote>
<p>From this definition, demand is not a single quantity. Rather, it is
a table or graph showing some prices that might be charged and the corresponding
amounts that buyers will want to buy.</p>
<p>"Quantity demanded" is the amount that will be bought at a particular
given price.</p>
<p>Follow the example in section two</p>
