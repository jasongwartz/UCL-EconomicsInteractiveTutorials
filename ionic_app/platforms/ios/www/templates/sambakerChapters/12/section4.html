	<h4>A Fair Game</h4>

	<p>A fair game has an expected value of £0. Roulette in America has an expected value of £-0.0528, approximately, so it's not "fair" in this sense.</p>

	<p>The casino could make roulette fair by adjusting the payoffs. For example, if betting on red or black and winning paid 20 to 18, rather than 1 to 1, then the game would be fair. Paying 20 to 18 would mean that if you bet £1 and won, the casino would give you about £1.11. Your expected value would then be:
	<br>18/38 times £20/18 (for when your color comes up), plus
	<br>18/38 times £-1 (for when the other color comes up), plus
	<br>2/38 times £-1 (for when green comes up),
	<br>which equals (£20 - £18 - £2)/38 = £0/38 = £0.</p>

	<p>There is an analogus concept for insurance: The <b>actuarially fair premium</b> is the premium that exactly equals the expected insurance payoff.</p>

	<br><h4>The Expected Value and the Law of Large Numbers</h4>

	<p>If you go into a casino with £10 and start betting £1 at a time at roulette, sooner or later you'll lose all your £10. Why is this? If your expected loss per £1 bet is £-0.0528, shouldn't you expect to lose just £0.528 when you bet £10?

	<question qid="risk2"></question>

	<p>The more times you play, the more likely it is that your net gain will be close to the game's expected value times the total amount that you have bet.</p>

	<p>If the game's expected value is less than 0, then what I called a "gain" in that sentence will really be a loss.</p>

	<p>We can illustrate this with a roulette simulation.</p>
