<p>Both answers are correct.&nbsp; Wendy's is not a monopolist, in any
sense that would get it in trouble with the law, but it is the only seller
of its particular brands and formulations.&nbsp; Economists call this kind
of market "monopolistic competition," a term coined by economist Joan Robinson.&nbsp;
Each firm that sells fast food has a demand curve with some slope; they
can sell more by lowering their prices, or sell less by raising their prices.&nbsp;
This means that the monopoly analysis can be applied.&nbsp; But the demand
curve is not very inelastic, so no great excess profits can be made, because
other firms' fast food can nearly substitute for Wendy's.</p>

price and expect to sell any.&nbsp; The firm doesn't lower its price below
the market price, because it can sell all it wants at the market price,
so why ask for less?</td>

quantity demanded does not go down to 0.&nbsp; If the firm lowers its price,
quantity demanded increases, so it is possible that a price cut might increase
revenue.</td>

<question qid="Mon015"></question>

<p>Most businesses we encounter in the course of a day are considered monopolistic
competitors.&nbsp; They are in markets that have <b>product differentiation</b>,
meaning that buyers can tell the difference between one seller's version
of the product and another seller's version. The seller's market power
is limited, however.&nbsp; In monopolistic competition, no great public
harm results if one seller raises price above the competitive level.</p>
<p>Medical practices, for example, have product differentiation.&nbsp;
People recognize differences among doctors, even though the differences
are often a matter of style, and not of measurable quality.&nbsp; A physician's
demand is usually not completely elastic.</p>
<p>The line between monopoly and monopolistic competition is a matter of
debate.&nbsp; Antitrust cases can turn on where the judge puts the distinction.&nbsp;
The issue is typically phrased in terms of what market is.  For example,
in the aluminum antitrust case of 1946, the Aluminum Company of America
(ALCOA) argued that its market was metals, and that its aluminum competed
with steel in the monopolistic competition sense.&nbsp; The judge decided
that aluminum was different enough from other metals to be a market of
its own, and that ALCOA had a near-monopoly of that market, which it did
in those days, selling 90% of new aluminum in North America.  (ALCOA also argued that 
the market should include scrap aluminum, as well as new aluminum.  The judge 
rejected that, too, on the grounds that all the scrap aluminum used to be new.)  </p>
<p>One possible distinction would be by the elasticity of demand at a competitive
price level.&nbsp; I might say that monopolistic competition is characterized
by elastic demand at competitive price levels, while monopolists have inelastic
demand at competitive price levels.&nbsp; By "competitive price level,"
I mean what the price would be if the market were competitive.&nbsp; This
qualifying phrase has to be added because an unrestrained profit-maximizing
monopoly will raise its price to where its demand is elastic, as the following
analysis shows.&nbsp; That is why, to use elasticity of demand as a criterion,
you have to ascertain what the price would be if the market were competitive. </p>
<p>This next section of the tutorial shows how monopoly (or monopolistic
competition) pricing decisions can be analyzed.&nbsp; The analysis is based
on the assumption that the firm seeks to maximize its profit.&nbsp; Real-life
firms can have other goals.&nbsp; This analysis shows what is theoretically
possible.&nbsp; It leads to the diagram, that you can find in almost any
introductory economics textbook, that shows a demand curve, a marginal
revenue curve, and a marginal cost curve.&nbsp; The profit-maximizing output
rate is where the marginal revenue curve and the marginal cost curve intersect.
