		<p>The Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory implies that you'd choose the first wheel both times or the second wheel both times.</p>

		<p>Wheel C is what you would get if you started with Wheel A and added 90 chances to win £1 million.</p>

		<p>Wheel D is what you would get if you started with Wheel B and added 90 chances to win £1 million.</p>

		<p>Standard theory says that if you like a certain something, call it A, better than something else, call it B, then you will like A + X better than B + X, regardless of what X is, as long as it's the same X added for both.</p>

		<p>Allais observed that this doesn't always work with risk, because people have a different attitude toward small risks.  Wheel D has a very small risk that you will get nothing, but many people will choose D anyway, even after choosing A for the first game.</p>

		<p>Think of the small risks you take, like crossing streets when you're walking near campus. Allais doesn't dispute the idea of risk aversion. He just questions whether people are as "rational" about the risks they face as the Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory assumes. Allais's ideas have relevance to the analysis of the politics of health and safety regulation.</p>
