		<h3>
A Fair Game</h3>
A fair game has an expected value of $0.&nbsp; Roulette in America has an expected
value of $-0.0528, approximately, so it's not "fair" in this sense.
<p>The casino could make roulette fair by adjusting the payoffs.&nbsp;
For example, if betting on red or black and winning paid 20 to 18, rather
than 1 to 1, then the game would be fair.&nbsp; Paying 20 to 18 would mean
that if you bet $1 and won, the casino would give you about $1.11.&nbsp;
Your expected value would then be:
<br>18/38 times $20/18 (for when your color comes up), plus
<br>18/38 times $-1 (for when the other color comes up), plus
<br>2/38 times $-1 (for when green comes up),
<br>which equals ($20 - $18 - $2)/38 = $0/38 = $0.
<p>There is an analogus concept for insurance:&nbsp;
The <strong>actuarially fair premium</strong> is the premium that exactly equals the expected
insurance payoff.
<h3>
The Expected Value and the Law of Large Numbers</h3>
If you go into a casino with $10 and start betting $1 at a time at roulette,
sooner or later you'll lose all your $10.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; If your
expected loss per $1 bet is $-0.0528, shouldn't you expect to lose just
$0.528 when you bet $10?
<p class="question">Choose the better explanation for why you lose all of your money:
<br>
<input type="radio" name="risk2" value="unlucky">I am unlucky.  If I go in with $10, on average, I should come out with $10 minus $0.528.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="risk2" value="repeat">If I keep betting, the total I have bet is more than $10.  I bet the same dollars over and over.</input>
<div id="risk2-answer"></div>


<p>The more times you play, the more likely it is that
<br>your net gain will be close to the game's expected value times the total amount that you have bet.
<p>If the game's expected value is less than 0, 
then what I called a "gain" in that sentence will really be a loss.
<p>We can illustrate this with a roulette simulation.
