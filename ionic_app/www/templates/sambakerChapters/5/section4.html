<h1>Making Demand More Elastic</h1>
<p>A way to have free choice for buyers and sellers but keep prices from rising forever is to make demand more elastic.</p>
<p>In a market system, demand becomes elastic if consumers are price conscious and if they have
an alternative. Here's an example of how this works to temper price increases:</p>
<p>Suppose that the market in our example above gets a new competitor 
who charges £3.50. Let us go to the extreme of supposing also that price is the consumer's only consideration.  There is no quality difference and no customer loyalty to a particular company. Then
the your demand might look like this.</p><br />

<br />
<br />
<p>If you charge less than your competitor's price, you get all of the business.
If you charge more than £3.50, you get no business. Your demand is now
highly elastic near the competitor's price.  If there is a competitor in your market, and
if the consumers care about price, then there's a definite limit to how
high you can raise your price.</p>
<p>This can be a highly unstable market because your competitor faces the
same situation. You can cut your price to £3.49 and take away all of the
business. Your competitor can then charge £3.48 and take it all back. Each
of you has the temptation to cut price on the other until one of you goes
broke. You see something like this when neighboring gasoline stations have
a price war.</p>

  <ion-radio ng-model="choice" name="choice" value="second">There's a competitor who charges £3.50. There is no product differentiation. If buyers can't tell your product from your competitor's (that's what "no product differentiation" means) demand will be elastic near the competitor's price.</ion-radio>
  <ion-radio ng-model="choice" name="choice" value="third">Demand is somewhat elastic. There's a competitor who charges £3.50, but there is product differentiation. Some customers will buy your product even if its price is a little higher. The same goes for your competitor.</ion-radio>

<p>When there is some product differentiation, which you can also think of as some 
customer loyalty, the market is more stable. A price war is less likely.  </p>

<question qid="q9"><question>

<p>In this market with product differentiation,
your highest revenue comes when you charge a price a bit higher than your
competitor. You are not going to start a price war by cutting your price below your competitor's price.  (This works this way because of how I rigged the numbers, of course.)</p>
<p>For providers of health care, such as physicians, other practitioners, and hospitals,
there is a lot of product differentiation.  Hospitals encourage this with their advertising.  Their billboards say, "We're the best!"  You never see a hospital billboard that says, "We're the cheapest!"   Patient loyalty reduces the elasticity of demand and helps keep prices up.</p>
