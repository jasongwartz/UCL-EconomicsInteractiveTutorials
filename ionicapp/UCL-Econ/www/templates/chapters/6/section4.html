<h3>Elastic and Inelastic</h3>
<p>The terms "elastic" and "inelastic" can be given a precise meaning in
terms of the number that comes out of the elasticity fraction.&nbsp; The
divider between elastic and inelastic demand is -1.&nbsp;
(For elasticities where you expect a positive relationship between Q and
P, such as for elasticities of supply, the divider is +1.)
<p>
If the demand elasticity is more negative than -1, the demand is elastic.
<br>If the demand elasticity is between -1 and 0, the demand is inelastic.
<blockquote>I avoided saying "higher" and "lower" in the above definition, because economists say that the elasticity of demand is "high" when it's a big negative number.  
They say that the elasticity of demand is "low" when it's a small negative number, meaning close to 0. The elasticity of demand for oil is low. The elasticity of demand for cubic zirconia (imitation diamond) is high.</blockquote>
<p>In our example, we got a price elasticity of demand of -0.5. <span class="question">Is this
elastic or inelastic demand?</span>
