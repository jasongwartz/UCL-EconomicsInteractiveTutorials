Elasticity -- A Quantitative Approach</h1>
Copyright &copy; 1996-1999 Samuel L. Baker.  Last modified 8/19/2013.
<p>The <a href="../elast/elast.html">first elasticity tutorial</a> took a qualitative approach to elasticity.
The idea conveyed was</p>
<p>Elasticity = Responsiveness</p>
<p>The elasticity of Q with respect to P is the responsiveness of Q to
changes in P.</p>
<blockquote>Q is the quantity demanded.  P is the price per unit.</blockquote>
<p>Elasticity has a quantitative meaning, too. Elasticity is a specific way of measuring responsiveness.</p>
<p>Suppose P changes, and Q changes as a result. <br></p>
The <b>elasticity of Q with respect to P</b> is the <strong>relative</strong> change in Q divided by the corresponding <strong>relative</strong> change in P.
<p>You can also say:<br></p>
The <b>elasticity of Q with respect to P</b> is the <strong>percentage</strong> change in Q divided by the corresponding <strong>percentage</strong> change in P.
<p>For example, if the price of something goes up by 1% and 
sales fall by 2%, the elasticity of quantity demanded with respect to price
is -2%/1% = -2.</p>
<br>
<strong>Don't neglect the minus sign.</strong> For demand, the elasticity number is negative, because price and quantity move
in opposite directions.
<p>You can write the elasticity formula this way:</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Change in Q) / (level of Q)
Elasticity = ---------------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Change in P) / (level of P)</pre>
<br />The numerator of this fraction is the change in Q relative to the level
of Q.
<br>The denominator of the fraction is the change in P relative to the
level of P.<br /><br />
<p>The elasticity concept can be applied to other things besides Quantity and Price.  You can use the concept whenever changing one thing makes something else change. For example, some researchers
have estimated the elasticity of population health status with
respect to the population's medical care expenditure. This elasticity is
the percentage difference in health status divided by the percentage difference
in medical care expenditure. (This elasticity usually comes out small,
by the way.)&nbsp; In this example, health status goes in the place of Q and medical care spending goes in the place of P.&nbsp; In the formula, you can consider Q and P as placeholders for anything
that changes in response to changes in something else.</p>
<p>There's a shorter way to say "the elasticity of Q with respect to P."
You can say "the P elasticity of Q," as in "the price elasticity of demand"
or "the income elasticity of demand." Here's the formula again for the
P elasticity of Q:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Change in Q) / (level of Q)&nbsp;
Elasticity = ---------------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Change in P) / (level of P)</pre>
<br />Let's try to apply this. Suppose that a medical practice finds that when the
price of a certain test is is $10, the quantity demanded is 100 tests per month, while if the price is $30, the quantity demanded is only  60 tests per
month.
<br>
What's the price elasticity of demand? Let's take this one step at
a time, because I have some points to make.</p>
<p>The first point is that, when you figure the changes in Q and P, you
do both in the same direction of time. Let's call the $10 price
and 100 quantity the &quot;before&quot; situation, and the $30 price and 60 quantity the "after" situation. To be consistent, you have to calculate all changes as &quot;after&quot; minus &quot;before&quot; or &quot;before&quot; minus &quot;after.&quot;   Let's calculate all changes as "after" minus "before."
