	<h4>Roulette Simulation</h4>

	<p>Below, after this explanation, is a roulette simulation. Before you try it, let me tell you how it works and what it is supposed to show.</p>

	<p>We will pretend that we are playing roulette. We will bet on Odd. This means we will win when the little ball on the roulette wheel lands on an odd number. We lose if the ball finishes on an even number. We also lose if the ball finishes on 0 or 00 because, in roulette, 0 and 00 are neither even nor odd.</p>

	<p>There is no little ball or wheel inside this computer, of course. Instead, we use a random number generator to simulate spins of the wheet.</p>

	<p>If we bet on Odd, there are 18 numbers that win for us: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so forth, up through 35. Twenty numbers lose for us: 2, 4, 6, 8, and so forth through 36, plus 0 and 00, which are neither even nor odd in roulette. Winning pays 1-1, meaning that we get £1 if we win and lose £1 if we don't. Our expected loss per bet is (18-20)/38 = £-0.0528 per dollar bet. The law of large numbers implies that, the more times we spin, the closer we should get to £-0.0528 per dollar bet.</p>

	<p>If you spin once, you will either win or lose. Your net gain per pound bet will be either 1 or -1.</p>

	<p>If you press the spin 10 button several times, your net gain per pound bet will vary, but it won't go nearly all the way to 1 or -1.</p>

	<p>If you press the spin 1000 button several times, your net gain per pound bet will vary, but not by nearly as much as for spinning 10 times.</p>

	<p>If you press the spin 1 million button several times, the net gain per pound spent will come out between -0.510 and -0.0540 almost every time. Suppose a roulette wheel in a casino gets two bets every thirty seconds, 12 hours a day. The casino is very likely to make between £51,000 and £54,000 on that roulette wheel.</p>

	<p>The more spins, the smaller is the bracket around -2/38.</p>

	<p>To further test your understanding of probability concepts, I have <a href="riskdoubletest.html">another roulette simulation. This one has the bettor use a doubling system</a>, a sure fire way to beat the odds? (This simulation uses a Java applet.)</p>

  <h4>Evaluating Securities</h4>

  <p>The application of this roulette model to evaluating financial securities is almost straightforward.</p>

  <p>I say "almost" is because of the important phenomenon of <b>risk aversion</b>. A risk averse person is one who is willing to pay money to avoid taking a risk. We discuss that in detail another interactive tutorial. (<a href="../RiskA/RiskA.html">This is a link</a>, but I recommend working through the rest of this tutorial first). Leaving risk aversion aside, the application of the roulette model is straightforward.</p>

  <p>Suppose you have the opportunity to buy a treasury bill from some country.</p>

  <blockquote>A treasury bill is a simple I.O.U., a promise to pay a certain amount of money at a certain time. A typical treasury bill might promise to pay £10,000 in one year. When you buy such a treasury bill, you are lending money, in effect. You give the country some money today. The country promises to give you £10,000 in a year.</blockquote>

  <p>If there is no risk that the country won't pay off the bill, then the value of the bill today depends on the current interest rate on no-risk loans. Investors considering buying the bill will offer an amount of money that is less than £10,000. They will offer at most the amount of money £X such that £X would grow to £10,000 in one year if invested in some other no-risk loan. In other words, the investor will offer the present value of a sure £10,000 one year from now.</p>

  <p>Let's say that the current interest rate on short-term treasury securities is 2% per year. For this no-risk treasury bill, you would offer at most the amount of money £X such that £X times 1.02 equals £10,000.</p>

  <p>We can write this equation:  X times 1.02 = 10000.  Divide both sides by 1.02 to get X = 10000/1.02 = £9803.92. (For more on this type of calculation, see the <a href="../dis/Dis.html">interactive tutorial on discounting future income</a>).</p>

  <p>This is why it is said that treasury bills sell "at a discount." You get the 2% interest by giving the treasury an amount that is less than the face value or future value. You give the treasury £9803.92 now. A year from now, they will give you £10,000. You will have earned 2% interest.</p>

  <p>Now let's suppose that another country is also selling £10,000 one-year treasury bills. This country's finances are shaky. You estimate that the probability is 90% that the country will actually pay the £10,000 when the year is up. There is a 10% probability that it will pay £0.</p>

  <p>Let us calculate the expected present value of that risky treasury bill.</p>

  <p>We can start with the present value if there were no risk. It is, £9803.92, if the interest rate on no-risk loans is 2%.</p>

  <p>Let us say that there are two possibilities:
  <ol>
    <li>The bond will pay £10,000 in one year.
    <li>The bond will pay £0 in one year.
  </ol>

  <p>From the paragraph above, we have that the probability of paying in full is 90%, and that the probability of paying nothing is 10%.</p>

  <blockquote>90% + 10% = 100%, so there are no other possible outcomes.</blockquote>

  <p>Place the decimal forms of 90% and 10% in the table below. In other words, type 0.9 and 0.1 in the boxes below. The only thing to figure out is which number goes in which box.</p>

  <button ng-click="risk2()">Type a number in each box. Then click this</button><br>
