<h5>Bonus for you:

<p>Here's the basic point about discounting future income, in the form of a question:
<p><a NAME="radio button question"></a>Which is worth more to you, according
to economic theory:
<br>$200 given to you today, or <br>$200 given to you one year from now?
<blockquote>Suppose that there is no risk. You absolutely, positively,
will get the money at the time you choose. Also suppose that there is no
inflation. $200 in one year will have the same buying power as $200 does
today.</blockquote>
<p  class="question">Which is worth more?
<br>
<input type="radio" name="dis1" value="today">$200 today is worth more.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="dis1" value="year">$200 in one year is worth more.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="dis1" value="same">No difference.  The two are worth the same, as long as I am protected against price inflation.</input>
<div id="dis1-answer"></div>
<div id="dis1A-answer">
<p>Leaving space until the above question is answered correctly.
