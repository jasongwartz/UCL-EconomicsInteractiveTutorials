		<h3>When equilibrium moves</h3>

<p>When prices or quantities change, that can be because the market is moving from disequilibrium to equilibrium.</p>
<p>Typically, though, when prices or quantities change, economists seek an explanation
in movements of the demand or supply curves. Economists like to assume that markets are naturally in equilibrium.  If they see something change, they figure that supply or demand must have changed.

<p>This video shows an animated supply and demand diagram.  The demand curve moves up and down while the supply curve stays still.  (You may need to click the play indicator near the bottom left of the frame.)</p>

<p>In the diagram, when demand grows, the demand curve moves up and to the right.  In supply-demand diagrams, to the right is up when you are talking about movements of the curves.  That is because when one of the curves moves to the right, it means a bigger quantity at every price.</p>
<p>When the demand curve moves up and the supply curve stays still, both the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity go up.

<p>This next video shows the supply curve moving while the demand curve holds still.</p>
