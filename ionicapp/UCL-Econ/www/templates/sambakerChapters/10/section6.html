<h3>
Internal Rate of Return Summary (so far)</h3></center>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
The internal rate of return is the interest rate that makes the present
value of the investment's income stream -- its costs and payoffs, discounted to the present -- add
up to 0.
<p>The internal rate of return is a measure of the worth of an investment.  Ignoring differences of risk, an investment with a higher internal rate of return is a better money-maker than an investment with a lower internal rate of return.
<blockquote>That generality has some exceptions.  We come back to this at the end of this tutorials.</blockquote>
