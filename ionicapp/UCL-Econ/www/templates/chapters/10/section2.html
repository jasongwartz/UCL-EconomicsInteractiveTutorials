		<h4>An Alternative Investment</h4>
Now let's consider an investment that our financial vice president has
proposed as an alternative to putting our $1000 in the bank for six years.
This investment involves buying a machine that will cost $1000. It will
give us $200 in operating profit per year for six years, starting the year
after we buy it. At the end of six years, the machine will have no value,
due to wear and obsolescence. There's no lump of money waiting for us at
the end, as there is with the bank account.
<p>This table shows the bank income stream and the machine income stream.

It's not obvious which investment is better, is it? We could try adding
up the income streams ...
<p>Bank Account: -1000 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 50 +1050 = 300
<p>Machine: -1000 +200 +200 +200 +200 +200 + 200 = 200
<p class="question">The income stream from the bank account adds up to $300. The income
stream from the machine adds up to $200. Does this make the bank account
better?

<input type="radio" name="irr1" value="yes">Yes.  Why make a simple problem complicated?</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="irr1" value="maybe">No, not necessarily.  We need a more complicated calculation.</input>

<p>The key is "present value" concept.&nbsp; This concept is reviewed below,
but it is introduced in its own <a href="../dis/Dis.html">
Interactive Tutorial on Discounting Future Income</a>. Please try that tutorial now if the above question
puzzled you.
<p>Why we need that concept: The bank account income stream pays more money in
total, but most of that income is in the big lump of $1050 in year 6. The
machine pays less in total, but it pays more money per year in the years
that come sooner.&nbsp; Getting the money sooner may give the machine's
income stream a higher present value than the bank's.</p>
