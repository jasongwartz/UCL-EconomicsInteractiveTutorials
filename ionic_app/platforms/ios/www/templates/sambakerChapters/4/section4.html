<h1>Demand Shifts</h1>
<p>Demand can shift. A shift in demand means that the relationship between
price and quantity demanded changes. In the graph, all the quantities shift
up (which is to the right) or down (which is to the left). In the table,
shifting up means that all the quantity demanded numbers get bigger, while
the prices stay the same. Shifting down means all the quantities demanded
get smaller at the same prices. For example, suppose some customers hear a rumor
that your gowns are not 100% waterproof.</p>

<blockquote>The bad rumor makes each point move to the left, which is "down." At
every price, there are fewer buyers than there used to be. This is what
economists mean by a "fall in demand."  The whole curve shifts to the left.</blockquote>

<p>At the old higher demand, you could sell 30 gowns a day at $2. <br /></p>

<br />
<p>When your demand shifts down, the amount you sell doesn't necessarily
go down. It depends on what you do with your price.</p>

<p>Do not type a $ sign. Just the number.</p>
