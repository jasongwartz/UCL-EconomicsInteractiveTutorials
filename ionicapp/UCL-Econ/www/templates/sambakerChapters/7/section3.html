		<h3>Equilibrium of supply and demand</h3>
<p>Here is a made-up demand schedule for primary care visits in an imaginary small city. The
table
below shows what quantities will be demanded at various prices.
</p>
<span class="morelineheight"><pre>Price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amount Demanded<br>&nbsp;$ 55 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 50 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 45 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 300 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 40 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 400 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 35 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 500 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 30 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 600 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 25 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 700 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 20 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 800 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 15 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 900 visits per day<br>&nbsp;$ 10 per visit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000 visits per day</pre></span>
I've ordered the prices from highest to lowest. This way, the higher
prices
are higher up on your screen. Just to be sure you understand the table,
please answer this: <span class="question">If the going price for an urgent visit is $10, how
many visits per day will be demanded? </span>
<br><input id="sd6-response" name="sd6" type="text"></input>
<button id="sd6-button">Type a number in the box.  Then click this.</button>
<div id="sd6-answer"></div>

<p>The $10 price is evidently
attractive
to consumers, since so many patients show up at that price.&nbsp; Let
us
imagine, however, that a $10 per visit price is not attractive to
providers.
Imagine that doctors and other providers would accept 0 visits if the
price were only $10.  If that is so, <span class="question">would this market be in
equilibrium if the price were $10?</span>
<br>
<input type="radio" name="sd7" value="yes">Yes, in equilibrium</input>
<input type="radio" name="sd7" value="no">No, not in equilibrium</input>
<div id="sd7-answers"></div>
<div id="sd7A-answer">
<p>Leaving space until the above question is answered correctly.
