<p>The internal rate of return does not require you to predict future discount 
rates. That would seem to make the internal rate of return the more useful 
(or less uncertain) measure.  Sometimes, though, the internal rate of
return can fool you. </p>
<h4> Contradictory Results</h4>
 A few years ago, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> published a study
that evaluated various types of professional education as if they were financial
investments. 
<blockquote>The article is: Weeks, W.B., Wallace, A.E., Wallace, M.M., Welch,
H.G., "A Comparison of the Educational Costs and Incomes of Physicians and
Other Professionals," <i>N Engl J Med</i>, May 5, 1994, <i>330</i>(18), pp.
1280-1286.</blockquote>
 The idea was to see if doctors were overpaid, by considering primary and 
specialty medical education as investments and comparing them with investing 
in education in business, law, and dentistry (but not university professors 
-- that would have been too embarassing). Adjustments were made for differences 
in average working hours. The authors found that primary medicine was the 
poorest investment of all of these.  Specialty medicine did better, but
was not out of line with the other professions. 
<p>In the results was this oddity: By the criterion of the net present value
of lifetime educational costs and income benefits, specialist physicians tied
for highest with attorneys.  Both were ahead of business school graduates. 
However, by the criterion of the internal rate of return, specialty physicians,
with a 21% average return, were well behind the attorneys' 25% average return,
while the business school graduates' 29% average return was the highest of
all.  The present value and the internal rate of return ranked the alternatives
differently! </p>
<blockquote>By the way, since this article's 1994 publication, managed care
has forced specialty physician incomes down by perhaps one-third.  This
has sharply lowered the investment value of a specialty medical education.</blockquote>
