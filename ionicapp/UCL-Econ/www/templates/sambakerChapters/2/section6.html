<h1>A different application of the marginal decision rule</h1>
<p>The idea of comparing marginal cost with the price can be applied to
cost-effectiveness analysis. For example, here are figures from a study about how often women should get Pap tests.</p>
<blockquote>The study is Eddy, D.M., "Screening for Cervical Cancer," <emphasis>Annals of Internal Medicine,</emphasis>
August 1, 1990, <emphasis>113</emphasis>(3), pp. 214-226.</blockquote>
<p>The study showed that the more often the test is done, the more lives are saved. 
However, the more often the test is done, the higher is the cost per year of life saved.
The Law of Diminishing Returns is at work.

<p>Suppose we put a price on life. We decide that a year
of life saved is worth $200,000. (How we decided that is a whole other discussion!)</p>
<p>Once we have that number, we can use it to decide how often women should get PAP tests.  The logic starts like this, at the top of the table:  Testing once every four years, as compared with never testing at all, adds $10,000 to total medical care costs for each year of life saved.  $10,000 is less than $200,000, which is what we say a year of life is worth.  Therefore, we should test once every four years, if the alternative is not testing at all.  </p> 
<question qid="MC14"></question>
<br />
<p>The Affordable Care Act requires that preventive services be offered free of copayment.  What will the standard be for PAP tests?  We will see.</p>
<p>Also, as more people get the HPV vaccine, there will be fewer cervical cancers for the PAP test to detect.  That will make higher the numbers for the marginal costs per year of life saved.  This logic may then imply doing PAP tests less frequently.
