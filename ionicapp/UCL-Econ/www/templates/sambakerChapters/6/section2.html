		<p>Here is the formula again.
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Change in Q) / (level of Q)&nbsp;
Elasticity = ---------------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Change in P) / (level of P)</pre>

<p>You have a choice of what level of Q should go into the formula.  There is no one right answer. The phrase "level of Q" is ambiguous. 
You could use the "before" level of Q, which is 100 in our example. You could use the "after" level of Q, which is 60 in our example.  You could use something in between.</p> 
<p>Whichever you use, be consistent between the top of the fraction and the bottom.  If you use the "before" level of Q in the top, use the "before" level of P in the bottom.</p>
<p>If the change in Q is small relative to the levels of Q, it doesn't matter much which Q you use for the level of Q. The elasticity
  comes out about the same regardless.</p>
<p>If you want a middle choice use the "arc elasticity."  It uses values halfway between "before" and "after." Let's show that.
<p>Here's the definition of arc elasticity:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Change in Q) / (average of Q's)&nbsp;
Arc Elasticity = ------------------------------------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Change in P) / (average of P's)</pre>
To get the average of the Q's, add them and divide by 2. The same goes
for the average of the P's.
<p>Let's use that in the calculation. 
<p>The data again are:
  <br>
  If the price is $10, demanded quantity is 100 tests per month.
  <br>
  If the price is $30, demanded quantity is 60 tests per month.
  <br>
  
<p class="question">What is the average of the Q's?

<div id="Elas203-answer">(When you answer the above question correctly, you'll be able to answer this next question.)</div>
<p class="question">... so the (Change in Q) / (average of Q's) is what?
