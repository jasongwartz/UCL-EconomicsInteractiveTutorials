	<p>In the power function, <img src="img/c13-s1-1.gif" width="96" height="33" border="0" alt="power function">, b is the elasticity of Y with respect to X. When X changes by 1%, Y changes by b%. For risk averse people, b is less than 1, so utility is relatively inelastic with respect to changes in income.</p>

	<p>On this graph, the slope changes as you go from left to right, but the elasticity is the same everywhere, thanks to our using the power function.</p>

	<p>To summarize, Von Neumann and Morgenstern recast your choice from being about different amounts of dollars to being about different amounts of utility. This lets them preserve the principle that one should always choose the alternative with the highest expected value. The down side is that they have to bring in an imaginary quantity, "utility," that is impossible to observe directly.</p>

	<p>Maurice Allais, an economics Nobel winner, pointed out that people don't always behave as the Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory says. Here's a version of one of his examples:</p>

	<p>Imagine that you may spin one of two Wheels of Fortune, A and B. Each has 100 numbers on it. For each wheel, the probability that any particular number will come up on any one one spin is 1/100. You only get to play this game once. The wheels pay off like this:</p>

	<div class="tborders">
	<table>
		<tr>
		  <td><b>Wheel A</b></td>
		  <td><b>Wheel B</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td><img src="img/WheelA.png" width="377" height="213" border="0" alt="Wheel A"></td>
		  <td><img src="img/WheelB.png" width="377" height="213" border="0" alt="Wheel B"></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Numbers 1 through 10 pay £1 million<br>Numbers 11 through 100 pay nothing</td>
		  <td>Numbers 1 through 9 pay £5 million<br>Numbers 10 through 100 pay nothing</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>

	<br><p>Wheel A offers a slightly better chance of getting rich. Wheel B offers a lot more money if you win.</p>

	<br><p>Now consider this game, which you would also get to play only once:</p>

	<div class="tborders">
	<table>
		<tr>
		  <td><b>Wheel C</b></td>
		  <td><b>Wheel D</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td><img src="img/WheelC.png" width="377" height="226" border="0" alt="Wheel C"></td>
		  <td><img src="img/WheelD.png" width="377" height="226" border="0" alt="Wheel D"></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Numbers 1 through 100 pay £1 million.<br>You are sure to win £1 million.</td>
		  <td>Numbers 1 through 9 pay £5 million.<br>10 pays nothing.<br>11 through 100 pay £1 million.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</div>
