<ion-view title="Internal Rate of Return">

		<p>You can get a present value $0.06 with a discount rate of .0547 or 5.47%.  That is as close to a $0 total as you can get unless you go to the next digit after the decimal point. </p>
<p>The internal rate of return for the machine is therefore 5.47%.   </p>
<p>Comparing the internal rates of return of the two investments, we see that the machine's 5.47% internal rate of return is higher than the bank account's 5% internal rate of return. This tells us that the machine is a better-paying investment.</p>
<p>Two cautionary notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The idea that better investments have higher internal rates of return is
appropriate for comparing investments that have their costs first and their
positive incomes later, and which have about the same initial costs. Our
imaginary bank account and machine fit this criterion, so we are OK to
use the internal rate of return for comparison. More on this issue at the
end of this tutorial.</li>

<li>
<b>Risk</b> can complicate the comparison of investments. For this tutorial
let us assume that the risks of our alternative investments are the same.
In particular, we will assume that the machine is just as safe as the bank
account.</li>

<br>In real life, investments that offer better payback generally carry
greater risks that the future income won't be paid. If the machine is riskier
than the bank account, you may prefer the bank account, even if its internal
rate of return is lower. Even so, the internal rate of return is useful
to know. It tells you how much caution would cost you, or how much reward
there is if you choose to assume some risk.</ol>
Let's look at the two investments again.&nbsp; Here are the income streams
and each investment's internal rate of return (IRR):

A student once asked: Suppose you don't need any money until year 6? Doesn't
that make the bank account better? The total of the income stream (not
discounted) is higher for the bank, and it gives you the money when you
need it.
<p>The answer is: Even if the times when you'll need money don't match
when the investment pays, you should still go by the internal rate of return.
That's especially true if the investment pays you money <b>before</b> you
need it.</p>
<p>That's because you can use the bank, even if you buy the machine. You
can deposit the extra income from the machine into a 5% account. At the
end of Year 6, you'll have a bigger lump of money than you would have had
if you had put your $1000 in the bank.
<p>Here's how it works, in laborious detail, after you buy the machine in year 0 for $1000:</p>


<hr>
<small>
<h3>At the end of Year 1, you get $200.
You keep $50 for spending, just like you would do for the bank account
(according to what we assumed).  You have $150 left over.  You put the extra $150 into the bank.</h3>

<b>End of year 1:</b>
<br>Starting bank balance is $0.00.&nbsp;
<br>The machine pays you $200.00.&nbsp;
<br>You take $50.00.&nbsp;
<br>You add to bank account $150.00.&nbsp;
<br>Bank balance is $150.00.&nbsp;


<br />
<h3>At the end of Year 2, the bank pays you 5% interest on your $150. That
makes your bank balance $157.50. At the same time, you get another $200
from the machine. You keep $50 of that for spending, and put $150 in the
bank. Your bank balance is $157.50 + $150 = $307.50.</h3>

<b>End of year 2:</b>
<br>Bank adds 5% of $150.00, which is $7.50.&nbsp;
<br>The machine pays you $200.00.&nbsp;
<br>You take $50.00.&nbsp;
<br>You add to bank account $150.00.&nbsp;
<br>Bank balance is $307.50.&nbsp;


<br />
<h3>At the end of Year 3, the bank pays you 5% interest on your $307.50.
That makes your bank balance $322.88. The machine pays you another $200.
You keep $50 and put $150 in the bank. Your bank balance is $322.88 + $150
= $472.88.&nbsp;</h3>


<b>End of year 3:</b>
<br>Bank adds 5% of $307.50, which is $15.38.&nbsp;
<br>The machine pays you $200.00.&nbsp;
<br>You take $50.00.&nbsp;
<br>You add to bank account $150.00.&nbsp;
<br>Bank balance is $472.88.


<br />

<h3>At the end of Year 4, the bank pays you 5% interest on your $472.88.
That makes your bank balance $496.52. The machine pays you another $200.
You keep $50 and put $150 in the bank. Your bank balance is $496.52 + $150
= $646.52.&nbsp;</h3>


<b>End of year 4:</b>
<br>Bank adds 5% of $472.88, which is $23.64.&nbsp;
<br>The machine pays you $200.00.&nbsp;
<br>You take $50.00.&nbsp;
<br>You add to bank account $150.00.&nbsp;
<br>Bank balance is $646.52.&nbsp;

<br />

<h3>At the end of Year 5, the bank pays you 5% interest on your $646.52.
That makes your bank balance $678.84. The machine pays you another $200.
You keep $50 and put $150 in the bank. Your bank balance is $678.84 + $150
= $828.84.&nbsp;</h3>

<b>End of year 5:</b>
<br>Bank adds 5% of $646.52, which is $32.32.&nbsp;
<br>The machine pays you $200.00.&nbsp;
<br>You take $50.00.&nbsp;
<br>You add to bank account $150.00.&nbsp;
<br>Bank balance is $828.84.&nbsp;

<br />

<h3>Finally, at the end of Year 6, the bank pays you 5% interest on your
$828.84 That makes your bank balance $870.28. The machine pays you its
last $200. Your withdraw the $870.28 from the bank, and you have $870.28
+ $200 = $1070.28. By comparison, at the end of six years with the bank
alone you get $1050. With the machine, you're ahead by $20.28. OK, it's
not that much, but it does show that even if you don't need most of your
money until Year 6, you wind up with more if you buy the machine.</h3>

<b>End of year 6:</b>
<br>Bank adds 5% of $828.84, which is $41.44.&nbsp;
<br>Bank balance is $870.28.&nbsp;
<br>The machine pays you $200.00.&nbsp;
<br>The total you finish with is $1070.28.&nbsp;</td>

<hr>


<p>Buy the machine, take out $50 a year from the proceeds, and you finish with $1070.28.  Using the bank alone, you finish with $1050.</p>
<p>So, if you need $50 a year for five years, and then all the money after six years, the machine/bank combination is a better investment than the bank alone.  You are better off buying the machine and then use the bank to earn interest on the money that you don't need right away each year. </p>
<p>If the machine investment pays you money <b>after</b> you need it (for
  instance, if you need $300 in Year 1) then you should compare the interest
  rate you'd pay to <b>borrow</b> money with the machine's internal rate
  of return.

<blockquote>A digression:&nbsp; We keep talking about the "internal" rate
of return.&nbsp; Were you wondering if there is such a thing as an "external"
rate of return?&nbsp; There is, and the above analysis is an example, because
it takes into account the interest that you can earn from machine's payments
in the bank, which is an investment separate from, and thus "external"
to, the machine investment itself. (Thanks to H.E.M. for putting me onto
this.)
