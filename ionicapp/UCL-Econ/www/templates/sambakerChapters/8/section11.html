		<h3>
Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, and the Profit-Maximizing Output Rate</h3>
Now let's go back to our table and add marginal costs to it: (The table
is getting big!)
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10
Quantity of visits demanded per hour:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9
Total Revenue:
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 210&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 240&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 250&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 240&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 210&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90
Marginal Revenue
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -70
Marginal Cost
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30
</pre>
To save space, I didn't include a row for Total Cost.&nbsp; We don't need
that to calculate the profit-maximizing output rate.&nbsp; All we need
is the marginal revenue, marginal cost, and the <b>restated marginal decision
rule:&nbsp; Expand output so long as the marginal revenue is greater than
the marginal cost.</b>
<br>What is our profit-maximizing output rate?

<br><p>Notice that, at 4 visits, we are in the elastic portion of the demand
curve.&nbsp; We don't just raise our price so long as the demand is inelastic.&nbsp;
We cut back even more than that, so as to give us the biggest profit above
our costs.</p>
<p>The monopolist allows 4 visits and charges $60 for each. A competitive
industry with the same costs and demand would, as we saw earlier, have
7 visits and charge $30 each.</p>
<h3>
What's So Bad About Monopoly?</h3>
With monopoly, there's an allocation and a distribution issue.&nbsp; The
distribution issue is easier to see:&nbsp; The monopolist raises the price.&nbsp;
This redistributes income from the costomers to the monopolist. That would
be a sufficient complaint for most of us, but not for orthodox economists,
who insist on not making value judgements about which people are more deserving
of income.
<p>Economists tend to emphasize the allocation issue, which we can illustrate
with our example.</p>
<pre>Price per visit:
$&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10
Quantity of visits demanded per hour:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9
Marginal Revenue
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -70
Marginal Cost
$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30

The profit-maximizing monopolist sets the price at $60 and has four visits
per hour.&nbsp; Somewhere out there, though, is a 5th person who would
come in if the price were $50.&nbsp; (We know this because the first two
rows tell us that if we charge $50 we can sell 5 visits per hour.)&nbsp;
That visit must therefore be worth at least $50 to that person.&nbsp; The
marginal cost of providing that visit is $15.&nbsp; (The fourth row of
numbers tells us that.)&nbsp; By not providing 5 visits, we are giving
up an opportunity to turn $15 worth of resources into $50 worth of service.&nbsp;
That's a net loss to society of $35.&nbsp; We are not using our resources
in the best possible way.
<p>This is called a "consumer surplus" argument, and we can make it again
with the 6th and 7th visits.&nbsp; By not providing that 6th visit, we
are failing to turn $15 worth of resources into $40 worth of service.&nbsp;
By not providing the 7th visit, we are failing to turn $15 worth of resources
(the marginal cost of the 7th visit) into $30 worth of service.</p>
<p>A competitive market would provide the 5th, 6th, and 7th visits.&nbsp;
If somebody could enter our market, they could make money providing those
visits, because the prices they could get would exceed the marginal costs.&nbsp;
A competitive market would stop at 7, because the 8th visit has a marginal
cost higher than the price you get get for it.&nbsp; Still, that's a lot
more than the 4 visits that the monopoly finds profit-maximizing.</p>
