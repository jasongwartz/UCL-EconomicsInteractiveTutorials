		<h1> Perils of the Internal Rate of Return</h1>
 Copyright &copy; 2000 Samuel L. Baker 
<p>The two most-used measures for evaluating an investment are the <b>net 
present value</b> and the <b>internal rate of return</b>. (Two earlier 
tutorials discussed these concepts. See the <a href="../Tutorials.html">tutorials list</a></a>
for links to tutorials for discounting future income and the internal rate of return.) </p>
<p>It is often assumed that higher is better for both of the net present value
and the internal rate of return. In particular, it is usually stated
that investments with higher internal rates of return are more profitable 
than investments with lower internal rates of return.</p>
<p>However, this is not necessarily so. In some situations, an investment 
with a lower internal rate of return may be better, even judged on narrow 
financial grounds, than an investment with a higher internal rate of return. 
This interactive lecture explores why and when this reversal takes place. 
</p>
<p>To review, both the net present value and the internal rate of return require
the idea of an income stream, so let's start there. An <b>income stream</b>
is a series of amounts of money. Each amount of money comes in or goes out
at some specific time, either now or in the future. The income stream
represents the investment; the income stream is all you need to know for
financial evaluation purposes. </p>
<blockquote>In real life, individuals, charitable institutions, and even for-profit
businesses have social or other goals when selecting investments. For
businesses, the benefits of community good will are no less real for being
difficult to measure precisely. For enterprises with social as well
as financial goals, the measures discussed here are still useful: They
tell you how much it costs you to advance your social goals.</blockquote>
 Here is an income stream example, from the interactive lecture about the 
<a href="../irr/irr.html">internal rate of return</a>. 
<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5">
 <tbody>
    <tr>
 <td valign="top">Year</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">0</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">1</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">2</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">3</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">4</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">5</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">6</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
 <td valign="top">Income amounts</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">-$1000</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">$200</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">$200</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">$200</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">$200</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">$200</td>
  <td align="right" valign="top">$200</td>
 </tr>
 
  </tbody>
</table>
 Here we see seven points in time and, for each, a dollar inflow or outflow.  
At year 0 (now), the income amount is negative.  Negative income is cost,
or outgo.  In this example, the negative income amount in year 0 represents
the cost of buying and installing the machine. 
<p>In the future, at years 1 through 6, there will be net income of $200 each
year. </p>
<p>All of the amounts in the income stream are <i>net</i> income, meaning 
that each is income minus outgo, or revenue minus cost. In year 0, the cost
exceeds the revenue by $1000. In years 1 though 6, the revenue will exceed
the cost by $200. </p>
<p>This investment evidently has no salvage value. That is, there is nothing 
that can be sold in year 6, the last year. If there were, the amount that 
could be realized from the sale would be added to the income amount for year
6. </p>
<p>For simplicity, all my examples have the incomes and outgoes at one-year 
intervals.  Real-life investments can have income and expenses at irregular
times, but the principles of evaluation are the same. </p>
<p>Now let's discuss our two measures in connection with this income stream:
