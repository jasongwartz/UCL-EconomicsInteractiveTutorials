		<h3>
The Von Neumann-Morgenstern Theory</h3>
<p>In my comment on your answer above, I snuck in the Von Neumann-Morgenstern
theory of risk aversion.  I wrote that the amount you typed in "is worth
twice as much to you as $10000." What could that mean? 
<p>Conventional economic
theory imagines that each of us is always maximizing our "utility." Utility
is like a meter in your head. The meter goes up when you acquire more stuff
that you want. Economists imagine that utility is a quantity that has units,
so it makes sense to say that alternative A has twice as much utility as
alternative B. John Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, co-authors of the
pioneering <i>The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</i> in 1944, developed
the idea of risk aversion. They explained it by saying that money (income)
has a declining marginal utility. Money, in other words, obeys the Law
of Diminishing Returns: The more you have, the less utility you gain from
getting a set amount more.
<p>In this case, their theory would say that getting $10,000 from winning
the first time brought you a certain amount of utility. Let's say it's
1 unit of utility. Winning $10,000 more dollars on top of that would not
add 1 more utility unit to your utility. Instead, it would add X utility
units, X being less than 1.
<blockquote>X is bigger than 0.  The second $10,000 is worth something to you, but it is worth less than your first $10,000.  This is an application of what economists' call the Law of Diminishing Returns.  </blockquote>
<p>If the second $10,000 is worth less than the first $10,000, risk averse behavior can be explained as "rational."
<blockquote>"Rational" is more economics jargon.  It means being motivated solely by maximizing one's utility.</blockquote> The utility for you of
the $20,000 that you might win is <i>not</i> twice as much
as the value of your first $10,000. The value of $20,000 is 1 + X, which is less than 2.
The expected value of a 0.5 chance of winning $20,000 becomes (1 + X)/2
utility units, which is less than 1. Thinking in terms of utility, rather
than dollars, the expected value of playing again is less than value of
keeping your $10,000.
<p>Suppose a $30,000 payoff in the second game would be just enough to
make you undecided between playing again versus taking the sure $10,000.
Von Neumann and Morgenstern would say that, for you, it takes an additional
$20,000 to add as much to your utility as the first $10,000 did. In other
words, if $10,000 is worth 1 "util" (short for the maginary utility unit)
to you, then $30,000 must be worth 2 utils.&nbsp; That way, both standing
pat and playing again have the same expected value, 1 util.
<p>Let me illustrate the idea of diminishing marginal utility of money with a graph.

<p>For the graph, I arbitrarily assign a utility value of 0 to having no
income. I assign a utility value of 1 to $10,000. When you click a button to a dollar
amount that would tempt you to play again, I give that amount the utility
value of 2. The Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory that
if you are indifferent between a a 100% chance
of a $10,000 prize and 50% chance of getting a certain bigger prize, then the utility of the bigger prize must be twice the utility of
$10,000.
<p>That gives me three points, ($0, 0), ($10000, 1), and ($X, 2), which
I plot on the graph with black dots. Then I draw the red curve, through
the points, to try to represent the utility to you of all amounts of money
from $0 to the bigger prize you picked.
<blockquote>The red curve has this formula:<img SRC="powerfunction.gif" BORDER=0 height=33 width=96 align=ABSCENTER>
Here, X is income, Y is utility, and A is a scaling constant determined
by my assignment of a utility of 1 to a $10,000 income amount. b is the
elasticity of utility with respect to changes in income. (We'll explain
what this means shortly.) This power function form is arbitrary, but
it's as good as any.</blockquote>
<p>The slope of this curve at any point represents the marginal utility
of income.&nbsp; In other words, the slope represents the addition to utility
that results from an additional dollar of income at that point. If the
curve is concave down (bends down), you have a declining marginal utility of income.
