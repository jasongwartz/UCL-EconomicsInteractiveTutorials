​<h1>The Marginal Decision Rule</h1>
<div class="card"><blockquote>
<b>Expand production if and only if the price is greater than the marginal
cost.</b></blockquote></div>

<p>The idea here is simple, once you get used to the jargon. Increasing
production makes both total cost and total revenue go up. If the revenue
goes up more than the cost, profit goes up. (Profit = total revenue - total
cost.) Marginal cost is how much cost goes up from making one more. The
price is how much revenue goes up from selling one more. (This is where
the price-taker assumption comes in -- you don't have to cut your price
to sell more.) If the price is bigger than the marginal cost, then what
you gain in revenue is greater than what you lose in added cost. That makes
your profit higher, so you should go ahead and expand production.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if price is less than marginal cost, increasing production
costs you more than the revenue you gain. You should not expand production.
Let's see how this works. Here is Joan's cost table, showing the total
cost and the marginal cost for each number of patients. Assume as before
that patients sign one year contracts, so we don't have to bother with
fractions of patients.</p>

In each row of this table, the marginal cost number is how much total
cost increases when going up to that rate of production from the next lower rate. You can think
of the Marginal Cost here as meaning "the marginal cost of adding <em>this</em>
patient." For example, the $3500 for marginal cost in the row for
1 patient means that serving 1 patient costs $3500 more than serving 0
patients.

Here's the top of that cost table again:<br /><br />
<div class="tborders">
<table CELLSPACING=5 >

<br><b>n</b></td>
​

<br>of <b>n</b> patients</td>

Suppose the going price is $3700. At that price, you can get
patients to sign contracts for your service.
We're going to work our way up to finding the number of patients that gives
you the most profit, starting from 0 patients.
​
To start, assume you are currently treating 0 patients -- no patients
at all. <span class="question">Would adding 1 patient make you better off?  If that patient would pay you $3700?</span>
<question qid="MC2"></question>
<br />
"Wait a second," you might say, "the table says my total cost of seeing one patient is $4500.  The patient is paying me only $3700, so I'm losing $800!  <span class="question">Shouldn't I see 0 patients?"</span>
<question qid="MC3"></question>
<br />
Let's look at the second and third rows of the cost table:
<br />
<div class="tborders">
<table CELLSPACING=5 >
<tr>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>Number of Patients
<br><b>n</b></td>
​
<td>Total Cost
<br>of <b>n</b> patients</td>
​
<td>Marginal Cost
<br>of the <b>n</b>th patient</td>
</tr>
​
<tr ALIGN=RIGHT>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>1</td>
​
<td>$4500</td>
​
<td>$3500</td>
</tr>
​
<tr ALIGN=RIGHT>
<td ALIGN=CENTER>2</td>
​
<td>$7500</td>
​
<td>$3000</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<br />
The price is still $3700. You are currently treating one patient. <span class="question">Should
you add a 2nd?</span><br />
<question qid="MC4"></question>
