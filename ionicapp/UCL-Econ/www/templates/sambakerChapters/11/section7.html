<h4> Can You Do Both Investments?</h4>
 Doing an investment increases your wealth if its net present value is greater 
than 0 at the discount rate relevant to you.  If your discount rate is
less than 5.47%, both NPV curves are in positive territory, and you should
do both, if you can. 
<p>Sometimes, though, the alternative investments are mutually exclusive.  
For example, there may be two ways to build a dam across a particular river.  
You can do one or the other, but not both.  There may be several alternative 
ways to address a workplace safety problem.  There is no point to doing
more than one if any one way solves the problem.  Deciding on a professional
education involves somewhat mutually exclusive choices.  A few people
do go to medical school and then law school, but the additional return from
the second degree is not the same as what someone going to law school fresh
out of college would expect. </p>
<p>If you can only do one investment, you should choose the one with the highest
net present value at the discount rate appropriate to you.  A problem
with that advice, though, is that discount rates can change with general
economic conditions.  You are therefore more confident about choosing
one investment over another if your chosen investment has a higher net present
value over a broad range of possible discount rates.  In our example
so far, the green-line investment has a higher net present value at all discount
rates, so we would choose it with confidence. Regardless of what happens
in the future to discount rates, we'll be better off with the green-line
investment than with the blue-line investment. </p>
<h4> Can NPV Curves Cross?</h4>
 Yes, they can.  If the NPV curves cross, then the choice of investment 
depends on the discount rate. 
<p>To create an example, I'll change the blue line investment so that its 
profits come much later.  This increases the effect of the discount rate
on the net present value.  Below are the two income streams, now. 
Also shown are their net present values at a 5% discount rate and their internal
rates of return.

 The green line invesment has the higher internal rate of return, but the 
blue line investment has the higher net present value at a 5% discount rate. 
Our two measures are giving us opposite advice! </p>

The graph shows what's going on, by showing the Net Present Value curves for
both investments for discount rates between 0% and 10%.  The curves cross
at a discount rate of about 0.064, or 6.4%. </p>
<p>Now, to choose which investment we want to do, assuming we cannot do both,
we have to make a guess about what future discount rates will be.  If
we expect discount rates to be less than 6.4%, where the curves cross, we
choose the blue line investment.  For discount rates above 6.4%, but
below 8.56% (the internal rate of return of the green line investment -- the discount rate at which the net present value of the green line investment is $0), we choose the
green line investment.  At higher discount rates than 8.56%, we don't
do either, because the net present values are below $0 for both investments. </p>
