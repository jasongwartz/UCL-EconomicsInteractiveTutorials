		<p>Excess demand is the amount demanded minus the amount supplied. At
a £10 price, there are 1000 visits per day of excess demand. 
<p>Excess supply occurs if the amount supplied is bigger than the amount
demanded.  That happens at high prices.
</p>
<p>In a market that conforms to the economic theory of a free market,
excess demand or excess supply 
encourage competition among the buyers or sellers.
This tends to make the price change. 
<p>Excess
demand
tends to induce competition among the buyers, which forces prices up.
Excess
supply tends to induce competition among the sellers, which forces prices
down. 
<p>Equilibrium is reached when there is no tendency for the price to
move either way. At equilibrium there is no excess demand or excess
supply.

<p>Let's add a supply schedule on the table.
