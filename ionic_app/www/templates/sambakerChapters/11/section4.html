	<h4>Internal Rate of Return</h4>

	<p>In the example we've been using, if you keep the income amounts at their original -1000, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, and 200, and set the discount rate to 0.0547, the net present value becomes 0. This discount rate, 0.0547 or 5.47%, is the <b>internal rate of return</b> for this investment -- it is the discount rate that makes the net present value equal 0. You can try this below, by setting the discount rate to 0.0547.</p>

	<p>If you now raise any of the income amounts in years 1 through 6 (feel free to edit an income amount and see for yourself), you will need a higher discount rate to bring the net present value back to 0. That would seem to imply that projects with higher incomes have higher internal rates of return.</p>

	<p>Similarly, if you lower any of the income amounts in years 1 through 6, then a lower discount rate will be needed to bring the net present value back up to 0. That would seem to imply that projects with lower incomes have lower internal rates of return.</p>

	<p>These seeming implications are actually often true, if the projects being compared have about the same shape, with the costs coming early and the benefits coming late, and if the projects being compared switch from net outgo to net income at about the same time. Otherwise, though, the implications might not be true.</p>
