		<h4> Internal Rate of Return</h4>
 In the example we've been using, if you keep the income amounts at their 
original -1000, 200, 200, 200, 200, 200, and 200, and set the discount rate
to 0.0547, the net present value becomes 0.  This discount rate, 0.0547
or 5.47%, is the <b>internal rate of return</b> for this investment -- it
is the discount rate that makes the net present value equal 0. You can try
this below, by setting the discount rate to 0.0547. <br>

<br>
If you now raise any of the income amounts in years 1 through 6 (feel free
to edit an income amount and see for yourself), you will need a higher discount
rate to bring the net present value back to 0.  That would seem to imply
that projects with higher incomes have higher internal rates of return. 
<p>Similarly, if you lower any of the income amounts in years 1 through 6,
then a lower discount rate will be needed to bring the net present value
back up to 0.  That would seem to imply that projects with lower incomes
have lower internal rates of return. </p>
<p>These seeming implications are actually often true, if the projects being
compared have about the same shape, with the costs coming early and the benefits
coming late, and if the projects being compared switch from net outgo to
net income at about the same time. Otherwise, though, the implications might
not be true. </p>
<p>Before we go on to that, a little review: </p>
<p>Which of these measures (net present value and internal rate of return) 
requires you to know the future income and outgo amounts? <br>

be in the future? <br>
