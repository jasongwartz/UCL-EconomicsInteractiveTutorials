		<p>This tutorial introduces the concept of demand. We'll include some numerical
examples to give you practice in interpreting demand charts and graphs.
<p>Let's start with a definition.
<h2>
ECONOMICS DEFINITION OF DEMAND</h2>
<p>"Demand" is the relationship between the price that is charged and the
amount that will be bought at that price.
<p>From this definition, demand is not a single quantity. Rather, it is
a table or graph showing some prices that might be charged and the corresponding
amounts that buyers will want to buy.
<p>"Quantity demanded" is the amount that will be bought at a particular
given price.
<p>Here's an example:
<p>Suppose that the table below shows the demand for your small company's
disposable surgical gowns. (Please forgive me if the prices are unrealistic.)
<b>The
key idea</b>, again, is that the <b>demand</b> is the <b>entire table</b>,
not any one number in the table.
