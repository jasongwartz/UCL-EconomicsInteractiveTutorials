	<h4>The Von Neumann-Morgenstern Theory</h4>

	<p>In my comment on your answer above, I snuck in the Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory of risk aversion. I wrote that the amount you typed in "is worth twice as much to you as £10000." What could that mean?</p>

	<p>Conventional economic theory imagines that each of us is always maximizing our "utility." Utility is like a meter in your head. The meter goes up when you acquire more stuff that you want. Economists imagine that utility is a quantity that has units, so it makes sense to say that alternative A has twice as much utility as alternative B. John Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern, co-authors of the pioneering <b>The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</b> in 1944, developed the idea of risk aversion. They explained it by saying that money (income) has a declining marginal utility. Money, in other words, obeys the Law of Diminishing Returns: The more you have, the less utility you gain from getting a set amount more.</p>

	<p>In this case, their theory would say that getting £10,000 from winning the first time brought you a certain amount of utility. Let's say it's 1 unit of utility. Winning £10,000 more dollars on top of that would not add 1 more utility unit to your utility. Instead, it would add X utility units, X being less than 1.</p>

	<blockquote>X is bigger than 0. The second £10,000 is worth something to you, but it is worth less than your first £10,000.  This is an application of what economists' call the Law of Diminishing Returns.</blockquote>

	<p>If the second £10,000 is worth less than the first £10,000, risk averse behavior can be explained as "rational".</p>

	<blockquote>"Rational" is more economics jargon. It means being motivated solely by maximizing one's utility.</blockquote>

	<p>The utility for you of the £20,000 that you might win is <b>not</b> twice as much as the value of your first £10,000. The value of £20,000 is 1 + X, which is less than 2. The expected value of a 0.5 chance of winning £20,000 becomes (1 + X)/2 utility units, which is less than 1. Thinking in terms of utility, rather than dollars, the expected value of playing again is less than value of keeping your £10,000.</p>

	<p>Suppose a £30,000 payoff in the second game would be just enough to make you undecided between playing again versus taking the sure £10,000. Von Neumann and Morgenstern would say that, for you, it takes an additional £20,000 to add as much to your utility as the first £10,000 did. In other words, if £10,000 is worth 1 "util" (short for the maginary utility unit) to you, then £30,000 must be worth 2 utils. That way, both standing pat and playing again have the same expected value, 1 util.</p>

	<p>Let me illustrate the idea of diminishing marginal utility of money with a graph.</p>

	<p>For the graph, I arbitrarily assign a utility value of 0 to having no income. I assign a utility value of 1 to £10,000. When you click a button to a dollar amount that would tempt you to play again, I give that amount the utility value of 2. The Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory that if you are indifferent between a a 100% chance of a £10,000 prize and 50% chance of getting a certain bigger prize, then the utility of the bigger prize must be twice the utility of £10,000.</p>

	<p>That gives me three points, (£0, 0), (£10000, 1), and (£X, 2), which I plot on the graph with black dots. Then I draw the red curve, through the points, to try to represent the utility to you of all amounts of money from £0 to the bigger prize you picked.</p>

	<blockquote>The red curve has this formula:<img src="img/c13-s1-1.gif" width="96" height="33" border="0" alt="power function"> Here, X is income, Y is utility, and A is a scaling constant determined by my assignment of a utility of 1 to a £10,000 income amount. b is the elasticity of utility with respect to changes in income. (We'll explain what this means shortly.) This power function form is arbitrary, but it's as good as any.</blockquote>

	<p>The slope of this curve at any point represents the marginal utility of income. In other words, the slope represents the addition to utility that results from an additional dollar of income at that point. If thecurve is concave down (bends down), you have a declining marginal utility of income.</p>
