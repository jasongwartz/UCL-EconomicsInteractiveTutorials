Supply and Demand</h1>

<p>This program discusses supply and demand. It shows, with a
simplified
numerical example, how supply and demand in a market interact to
determine
how much of something is sold and bought, and what the price is.
</p>
<p>The crucial economic theory ideas are:
<ol><li> Supply and demand are determined
separately.</li>
<li>The <span style="color:brown; font-weight:bold">sellers</span> determine the <span style="color:brown; font-weight:bold">supply</span>. The <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">buyers</span> determine the <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">demand</span>.</li>
<li>In a free competitive market, there is, at any time, a price at which the good or service is being bought and sold.  Potential buyers decide whether they want to buy at that price.  Potential sellers decide whether they want to sell at that price.</li>
<li> In a
free competitive market, the price of whatever it is moves up or down
until
the amount supplied equals the amount demanded. When the price stops
moving,
you have what is called <b>equilibrium</b>.</li></ol>
