		<h3>
Insurance and Risk Aversion</h3>
Enough fun and games. Back to something serious -- insurance.
<p>The theory of risk aversion was developed largely to explain why people
buy insurance.
<p>Buying insurance is hard to justify using the theory of expected value.
That's because buying insurance is a gamble with a negative expected value,
in dollar terms.
<p>Regular indemnity insurance specifies that you get money if certain
things happen. If those things don't happen, you don't get any money.
So far, that's just like playing roulette.
<p>In return for the chance to get some money, you bet some money by paying the insurance company a "premium."  The insurance company keeps your premium if you don't have a claim.  So far, that's still just like
playing roulette.
<p>Over the large number of people who sign up for insurance, the insurance company pays out less money in claims than it takes in. If it doesn't, it can't stay in business. Your expected payoff is therefore less than your premium, unless you can fool (or legally force) the insurance company into selling you a policy with odds are in your favor. Buying insurance has a negative expected value. Still just like playing roulette.
<p>Except that insurance is worse than roulette. Roulette's expected value is about -5% of the amount bet. The expected value
of a private health insurance policy is about -15%, relative to the amount bet, the insurance premium paid. This is what Obamacare requires for large health insurance plans, like Blue Cross. It's what the insurers mean when they say that their "medical loss ratio" is 85%. 
<p>Before Obamacare, some insurers sold policies to individuals or small groups with medical loss ratios of 60% or less.  These policies' expected values were -40% of the amount bet, or worse. 
<p>We have this, therefore:
<table border cellspacing="2" cellpadding="4" border="0">
<tr>
    <td><strong>Type of Gamble</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Expected value,<br>relative to amount bet</strong></td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Health insurance</td>
    <td>You lose 15% of each bet, on average.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Roulette</td>
    <td>You lose 5% of each bet, on average.</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="question">We conclude that roulette is much better deal than health insurance. <br>Right?
<br>
    <input type="radio" name="riska7" value="right">Right.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="riska7" value="wrong">Wrong!  It's smart to buy insurance.</input>
<div id="riska7-answer" class="question"></div>

<p>Let's go through a numerical example.
<p>Suppose you face a 1/100 chance
of losing $10,000.  If you are risk averse, you will pay more than
$100 (the expected or "actuarially fair" value) for an insurance policy
that would reimburse you for that $10,000 loss, if it happens.
<p>Suppose there are many people like you, and you'd each be willing to
pay $110 to avoid that risk of losing $10,000. You all could join together
to form a mutual insurance company, collect $110 from each member, pay
$10,000 to anyone who is unlucky and loses, and come out ahead, probably.
The more participants in your mutual insurance company, the more likely
it is that you'll have money left over for administrative costs and profit.&nbsp;
That's how insurance companies with "Mutual" in their name got started.
<p>How can an insurance company assume all these risks?&nbsp; Isn't it
risk averse, too?
<p>The insurance company can do what an individual can't: Play the game
many times and get the benefit of the Law of Large Numbers.&nbsp; The larger
an insurance company is, the better it can do this.
