Summary</h3>
Marginal revenue is the change in revenue that results from a unit change
in the amount sold.&nbsp; The marginal revenue curve can be mathematically
derived from the demand curve.
<p>Monopolies (or any firms with downward-sloping, non-perfectly-elastic,
demand curves) maximizing their profit by raising price and reducing output
so long as the demand is inelastic.&nbsp; Then they raise the price even
more, until the marginal revenue lost from the reduction in sales is greater
than the marginal cost saved thanks to a lower rate of operation.
<p>The monopoly's high price transfers income from customers to the monopolist.&nbsp;
The monopoly's low output rate wastes social resources, by not turning
some resources into products that would be valued more highly than the
resources are.
<h3>
Comment</h3>
Monopolies cause other problems, too.&nbsp; They can have higher costs
than necessary, taking their monopoly profits in the form of extra costs.&nbsp;
Monopolies can ignore opportunities to innovate in their own industries.&nbsp;
They can aggressively stifle innovation in related industries if they see
a threat to their existing monopoly.  All these issues go beyond the price theory that this tutorial is about, and may be more important.
