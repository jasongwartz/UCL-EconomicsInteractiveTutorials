<h3>
The Discount Rate is the Interest Rate Used in Reverse</h3></center>
When an interest rate is used in reverse like this, to calculate how much
you need now to have a certain amount later, economists conventionally
use the term <b>discount rate</b> rather than interest rate. The two terms
mean the same thing. A reason for using the term "discount rate" when you
calculate a present value is that you are taking a larger number, the future
value, and calculating from it a smaller number, the present value.
<p>In the literature, I have found two ways to define "discount rate."
<p>One way is to just call the interest rate the discount rate.
<br>That makes our general formula Present Value = (Future Value) / ( 1
+ Discount Rate )&#8319;.
<p>The U.S.'s central bank, the Federal Reserve, says on its web site, "The discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks and other depository institutions on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank's lending facility--the discount window."  That is the first definition of "discount rate."   
<p>The alternative definition of the discount rate, used in some textbooks, is Discount rate = 1/(1 + interest rate).
<br>This makes the general formula Present Value = (Future Value) &times; (Discount Rate)&#8319;.
<p>If the interest rate is 5%, the discount rate, by this second definition, is about 0.9524, what 1/1.05 equals. 
<p>The two definitions lead to exactly the same results.  I think the first definition is more intuitive.
<p>It is usually easy to tell which definition is being used from the number that they quote.  If the number is a little more than 0, they are using the first definition.  If the number is a little less than 1, they are using the second definition.  For example, the Federal Reserve's discount rate for Primary Credit is 0.75% (at this writing).  That confirms that they are using the first definition.  By the second definition, that would be a discount rate of 99.256%.
<p>Either way, the discount rate measures the opportunity cost of capital -- how much interest you could earn if you put your money in an interest-bearing safe investment.
