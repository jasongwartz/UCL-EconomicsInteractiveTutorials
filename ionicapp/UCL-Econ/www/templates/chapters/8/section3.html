Marginal Revenue</h2>
The concept we'll need to analyze monopoly pricing and output decisions
is "marginal revenue."&nbsp; We'll develop the marginal revenue concept
with some numerical examples.
<h3>
Marginal Revenue Defined</h3>
Marginal revenue is defined as the addition to total revenue that comes
increasing by one unit the rate at which you sell your product or service.
<p>You might think that the additional revenue you'd get from selling one
more unit per day (or whatever time period you want) would just be the
price at which you sell the extra unit.&nbsp; That's true if you are a
price-taker, but not if you are a price-maker.
<p>If you are a price-taker, and you want to sell one more unit per day,
you just sell it.&nbsp; Your demand is elastic and the market will take
all you want at the going price.
<p>If you are a price-maker, and you want to sell one more unit per day,
you must lower your price.&nbsp; This makes the calculation of how much
revenue you gain more complex.&nbsp; You get some additional revenue by
increasing the rate of your sales, but you also lose some revenue because
you are getting less money for each item sold.&nbsp; For this reason, your
marginal revenue less than your price.&nbsp; It is even possible for the
marginal revenue to be negative.&nbsp; This happens if what you lose from
lowering the per-item price is more than what you gain from selling additional
items.
<p>Not yet clear?&nbsp; Don't worry.&nbsp; Let's go through an illustration.&nbsp;
We start with the simpler case, the case of the price-taking firm.
