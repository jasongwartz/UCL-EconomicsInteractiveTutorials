	<h4>Effective Interest Rates Vary According to Risk</h4>

	<p>In the example above, Country X is, in effect, paying a higher interest rate because its bills are risky. The interest it is paying can be calculated like this:
	<br>We want the interest rate i such that (1 + i) = £10000/£8823.53.
	<br>i = £10000/£8823.53 - 1.
	<br>i = 0.133, approximately, or 13.3%.
	<br>That's much more than the 2% that the sure-bet country is paying. Riskier borrowers have to pay higher interest rates. That's the main reason why, for example, on January 13, 1999, 6-month US Government bonds were paying interest at an annual rate of about 4.5%, RJR Nabisco Corporation bonds were paying about 8%, and Argentine telephone company bonds were paying about 11%.</p>

	<p>A dramatic example of changing the assessment of risk happened during August 2007. Starting around 2002, banks and similar financial institutions took home mortgages, assembled them into groups, and then sold them to investors. What the banks were selling was the right to collect homeowners' payments on their mortgages.</p>

	<p style="color:green">The material after this paragraph was written a few years ago. I'm thinking now that the interest rate differences are a better measure of risk than the ratings from the ratings comanies. <a target="_blank" href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/08/08/us/politics/fivethirtyeight-0808-sp4/fivethirtyeight-0808-sp4-blog480.jpg">See this chart, from Nate Silver's blog, which shows how poorly the ratings correlate with the risk of default.</a> For this chart, the measure of risk, on the Y-axis, is how much you have to pay to buy insurance that will pay you if the country defaults. See also <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/07/24/the-activist-ratings-agencies-and-their-poor-public-sector-predictions/" target="_blank">The Activist Ratings Agencies and Their Poor Public Sector Predictions</a>. In particular, when the credit raters downgraded U.S. debt in August 2011, the interest rates that the U.S. was paying did not go up.</p>

	<p>Assessing the risk of these mortgage-backed securities was a job for ratings firms, particularly Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's. These are well-established companies that have been in the ratings business for many years. (Here is a link to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PBgEAAAAMAAJ&dq=moody+truth+trusts&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=U5OBEsC7Wb&sig=v4L4DKHmsoDUNmjKBTBgTEANfpg#PRA1-PA501,M1">John Moody's 1904 book</a> about why monopolies -- then the darlings of Wall Street but the bane of Progressives -- were good things, in Moody's view. <span style="color:green">Hmm ... they haven't changed much!</span> )</p>

	<p>Moody's and Standard & Poor's have alphanumeric designations for different levels of risk. The chart to the right shows the Standard & Poor's categories with some examples. Borrowers high on that list, like the United States Treasury, are considered low risk. These borrowers pay the lowest interest rates. Interest rates are higher for borrowers lower on the list. As of August 2007, the best junk bonds (BB+) pay about 4.5; percentage points more than the best investment grade bonds. The differences can change, though. According to the Wall Street Journal, August 20, 2007, the difference between what A borrowers pay and what the U.S. Treasury pays widened from about &frac14; percentage point in July to more than 2 percentage points in mid-August. Ordinarily, the value of a bond depends on the expected value of its future payments. That is what this tutorial teaches. The widening interest difference between AAA and A bonds from July to August 2007 suggested that something else was going on: Investors were panicking. They were avoiding buying corporations' bonds because other investors were doing the same, and the investors were afraid that they would not be able to resell the bonds if they bought them. One day, the demand for commercial paper -- corporations' I.O.U.s -- almost disappeared. Sales of commercial paper that usually took an hour were taking most of the day. It was like a stampede. If you are in the middle of one, you have no choice but to run with the crowd. This was scary, because a corporation that cannot "roll over" its bonds is in the same mess as a homeowner who has a balloon payment due and cannot refinance. Central banks in Europe and the U.S. stopped the stampede by loaning money at lowered interest rates to banks that bought corporate bonds. That seems to have partly worked. Commercial paper is getting bought and sold, but the interest rate spread is still high.</p>

	<p>(Some commentators wonder why governments could not similarly encourage bridge loans to hard-pressed homeowners. That is a topic for another place!)</p>

	<p>The mortgages in the mortgaged-backed securities were risky to various degrees, depending on such things as how big the down payment was, what the income of the homebuyer family was, and how much credit card or other debt the family was carrying. "Prime" mortgages are home loans with big down payments to families with enough income to meet standards and little or no other debt. "Sub-prime" mortgages are home loans with looser requirements. There are lots of gradations of risk within the sub-prime category. Standard & Poors, Moody's, and other rating companies reviewed the mortgages and estimated, based on recent experience, the probability that each mortgage would be paid.  Banks bundled higher probability mortgages together and sold them as packages -- mortage-backed securities -- to investors. Standard & Poor's and other raters gave these securities investment-grade ratings (see table). Those securities could be sold to pension funds and other institutions looking for good returns with low risk. Meantime, the low-probability mortgages were bundled into junk-rated securities. Those went to buyers able and willing to take more risk.</p>

	<p>In ordinary times, this can work fine. It did work, up until mid-2006. Homeowners occasionally fall behind on their mortgages for individual reasons, like job loss, divorce, or expensive medical care. These independent random events were expected. Pooling mortgages into groups spreads risk, just like insurance, and the higher interest rates on the riskier securities covered the losses, just as insurance premiums ordinarily do.</p>

	<p>Then the housing bubble started to deflate. Banks and mortgage companies had been lending to riskier and riskier people to buy houses. By late 2006, this was backfiring. A growing number of homebuyers were failing to make even their first mortgage payment. Banks pulled back on making risky new loans. This reduced the flow of homebuyers. House prices stopped rising, and started falling in some areas. Homeowners who were counting on refinancing their mortgages could not do so, because they could not get a new mortgage loan as big as the old one. Their houses were not worth as much. Defaults were no longer independent events. Lots of homebuyers were defaulting at once, being stuck with loans that they could not refinance and houses that they could not sell except at a loss.</p>

	<p>Ratings companies realized that the past experience that they had been using to assess risk no longer applied. In March 2007, Standard & Poor's was predicting that housing prices would be flat in 2007 and then rise in 2008. By July 2007, Standard & Poor's was predicting an 8% fall in housing prices into early 2008. That month, Moody's and Standard & Poor's lowered the ratings on about a thousand securities that were based on sub-prime mortgage loans. Big international investors got worried about lending money to financial corporations that were counting on income from these mortgage-backed securities. Then the big investors got worried that <b>other</b> big investors were worried about lending to financial corporations held a lot of mortgage-backed securities. No one wants to be the last person to lend money to a loser. That sparked the panic described above.</p>

	<p>The ratings companies defend their risk-assessment methodology. They say that they are used to being blamed when things go sour. </p>

	<br><h4>The financial crash and interest rates</h4>

	<p>In mid-September, 2008, after the U.S. Government declined to bail out the failing Lehman Brothers investment bank, the perceived difference in risk between the U.S. Teasury and big banks widened considerably. On one morning (Sept. 18), the "TED" spread, which is the difference between the interest rate on three-month U.S. Treasury bills (3-month I.O.U.'s) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (what big banks charge other big banks for overnight loans), jumped to 3 percentage points. In calmer times (like March 2008), the interest rate diffence was about 1/4 of a percentage point. Banks with spare cash flocked to U.S. Treasury bills, driving the interest rate on 3-month bills down on 0.05%. No, that is not a typographical error. Banks were so eager to lend their money to a safe borrower that the U.S. was borrowing at an interest rate of 1/20th of a percent. Lending among banks was almost nil, until the U.S. and other governments announced measures to pump money into the world's banking system. In the U.S., those measures included the TARP program.</p>
