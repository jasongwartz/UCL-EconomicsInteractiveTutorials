		<h2>
Moving Along the Demand Graph versus Shifts in the Demand Graph</h2>
<p>In general parlance, statements like "Demand went up" or "Demand will go down" are ambiguous.
They can mean a movement along the demand graph, as price changes, or
they can mean a shift of the whole demand graph.
<p>Here are some situations where someone might say the demand changed.
Which ones are changes in the quantity demanded, moving along the demand
curve in response to price changes? Which ones are changes in the demand
curve itself?
