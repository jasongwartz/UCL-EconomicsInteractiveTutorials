Once income falls this far, people will no longer want to take money out
of the bank to buy machines. The supply of machine products will stop expanding,
and the income you can get from a machine will stop falling. (Given the
time lag in decision-making, income may fall further than this and then
later come back up. Equilibrium will be reached when there's no incentive
to shift money either from bank to machine or from machine to bank.)
<p>How economic shortage fits with this:</p>
<p>If an investment has a high rate of return that persists over a long
period of time, economists infer that competition must not be working as
it should to lower income and equalize rates of return.</p>
<p><b>Normal profit</b> is profit equivalent to what you could earn in
the bank. No business would persist that didn't earn normal profit. Why
put money into a business if you can do better in a no-effort bank account?
But if the return to an investment stays higher than normal for a long
time, that's an indication of an economic shortage, and some kind of monopoly
restriction.</p>
<p>Speaking of above-normal profit and economic shortages, medical equipment makers are notorious for selling equipment in the U.S. at a generous markup over cost.</p>
<p>If there is competition in the machines' products' market, and incomes fall to where the incentive to buy more machines is gone, then the demand for machines will now be elastic.  A reduction in the price of the machine to £985 would put the IRR back up to 5.47%.  Machine manufacturers would start making money again, until the IRR for the machines' users got back down to 5%.</p>
<p>Looking at this from the opposite direction, if there is no competition in the market for the machine's product, the price of the machine can stay high.</p>
<p>Medical school, internship, and residency are, for the individual doctor, an investment with an IRR.  In the past, surgical specialty education had a higher IRR than primary care education.  This helped induce new M.D.s to go into specialties.  If, with more government payment control, the IRR for specialties drops, that may turn off the incentive that lures doctors into specialties.  If doctors' incomes get so low that the IRRs are less than student loan rates, there could be shortages of doctors in the future.  </p>
<p>In other countries, they solve this by making medical education practically free for the student.  Lowering the initial cost raises the IRR for a medical career.  This also helps the medical schools compete with other professions' schools for students.   </p>
