		<p>The first step is to write out the income stream. I'll expand that compressed description of the bond:
<ul>
<li> - In year 0, you pay out £800 to buy the bond.
<li> - In years 1 through 4, you get 1% of £1000 (which is £10) as an interest payment.
<li> - In year 5, you get a £10 interest payment, and you get the £1000 face value of the bond.
</ul>
