  <h1>Summary Notes on Demand</h1>
  <p>Source: Economics Network (www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk)</p>

  <h4>Demand</h4>
  <p>Demand is a schedule which shows the various amounts of a product consumers are willing and able to purchase at each price.</p>
  <p><b>Law of Demand</b> - all else constant, as price falls, the quantity demanded rises. Similarly, as price increases, the corresponding quantity demanded falls. This relationship leads to the downward sloping demand curve.</p>

  <p>Rationale:</p>

  <p>1.) Common sense and simple observation seems to substantiate this assertion</p>

  <p>2.) Consumption is subject to diminishing marginal utility - consuming successive units of a particular product yields less and less extra satisfaction. For example; after the first hamburger getting a second hamburger is less appealing because the person is not as hungry.</p>

  <p>3.) The <b>income effect</b> - a decline in the price increases the purchasing power of a buyer's money, enabling him or her to buy more of the product than before.</p>

  <p>4.) The <b>substitution effect</b> - at a lower price, buyers have the incentive to substitute the cheaper good for similar goods which are now relatively more expensive. For example, at a lower price, beef is relatively more attractive and is substituted for pork, mutton, chicken, etc.</p>

  <br><h4>Determinants of Demand</h4>

  <p>The determinants of demand are also known as demand shifters. They result in the leftward (decrease) or rightward (increase) shifts in the demand curve.</p>

  <p>1.) Tastes or preferences of consumers</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an increased taste in a product increases its demand</li>
        <li>a decreased taste in a product decreases its demand</li>
      </ul>

  <br><p>2.) Number of consumers in the market</p>
      <ul>
        <li>more consumers increases a products demand</li>
        <li>fewer consumers decreases a products demand</li>
      </ul>

  <br><p>3.) the money incomes of consumers</p>

  <p><b>Superior goods or normal goods</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>As income increases, a superior good's demand increases</li>
    <li>As income decreases, a superior good's demand decreases</li>
    <li>Superior goods are most common goods</li>
  </ul>

  <br><p><b>Inferior Goods</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>As income increases, an inferior good's demand decreases</li>
    <li>As income decreases, an inferior good's demand increases</li>
  </ul>

  <br><p>4.) prices of related goods</p>

  <p><b>Substitute Goods</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>As price of A increases, demand for B increases</li>
    <li>As price of A decreases, demand for B decreases</li>
    <li>Example: Nike's and Reeboks</li>
  </ul> 

  <br><p><b>Complementary Goods</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>As price of A increases, demand for B decreases</li>
    <li>As price of B decreases, demand for B increases</li>
    <li>Example: computers and computer games; gasoline and motor oil</li>
  </ul> 

  <br><p><b>Independent Goods</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>As price of good A changes, demand for good B does not change</li>
  </ul>

  <br><p>5.) consumer expectations about the future prices and incomes</p>

  <ul>
    <li>if consumers expect a price increase in near future, demand increases</li>
    <li>if consumers expect a price decrease in the near future, demand decreases</li>
  </ul>

  <br><h4>Terminology Clarification</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>"change in quantity demanded" - designates the movement from one point to another point - from one price-quantity combination to another - on a fixed demand curve</li>
    <li>"change in demand" - a shift in the entire demand curve either to the right (an increase in demand) or to the left (a decrease in demand). </li>
  </ul>

  <br><h4>Price Determination</h4>

  <p>We always want to produce at the most economical quantity-price combination. Graphically, the intersection of the supply curve and the demand curve for the product will indicate the <b>equilibrium point</b> - where there is neither a shortage nor a surplus.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A surplus occurs when there is too much supply and not enough demand at a particular price.</li>
    <li>A shortage occurs when there is too much demand and not enough supply at a particular price.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Eventually, the market will shift toward equilibrium. The ability of the competitive forces of supply and demand to establish a price where selling and buying decisions are synchronized or coordinated is called the <b>rationing function of prices</b>.</p>

  <br><h4>Changing Supply and Demand Curves</h4>

  <p>Demand Curve</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All else constant, a decrease in demand causes a decrease in equilibrium price and quantity demanded.</li>
    <li>All else constant, an increase in demand causes an increase in equilibrium price and quantity demanded.</li>
  </ul>

  <br><p>Supply Curve</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All else constant, a decrease in supply causes an increase in equilibrium price and a decrease in equilibrium quantity supplied.</li>
    <li>All else constant, an increase in supply causes a decrease in equilibrium price and an increase in equilibrium quantity supplied.</li>
  </ul>

  <br><p>Complex Cases</p>

  <p>If both supply and demand curves change, the result is indeterminate - the changes on equilibrium price and quantity depend on how much each curve has changed.</p>
