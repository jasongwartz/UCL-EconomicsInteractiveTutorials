<h1>What difference does demand elasticity make?</h1>
<p>Consider the following graph and table.</p>

<br />
<p>The graph and table again:
<br />
<img src="img/c5-s2-1.png" class="fullWidth" width="600" height="auto" />
<br />

<br />
<p>On the above graph, the points on the graph form a vertical line. This
line definitely does not slope gradually down from left to right. Regardless
of whether the price is £1 or £6 or anything between, the amount sold will
be the same, 40 units. Like any extreme, it's hard to find a real life
example, but emergency medical treatment for severe trauma in the sole
hospital in a region might fit this model. Lower health care prices will not encourage
people to go get themselves shot or run over, nor will higher prices keep
customers away.</p>

<p>The traditional medical model, also known as the Rule of Rescue, implies that demand should be inelastic. If health
care professionals provide what they judge that the patient "needs" regardless
of cost, and if the patient is unable to object or is fully insured or
both, then demand will be inelastic.</p>
