<h1>Pricing when demand is price-inelastic</h1>
<h3>If demand for your product is inelastic, what should you do with your
price? </h3>

<question qid="q7"></question>

<br />Let's see why that's so:<br /><br />

<br />
<br />
Revenue -- how much money you bring in -- equals Price times Quantity.
<p>If your demand is inelastic, the more you charge, the more revenue
you take in, since the amount you sell doesn't go down.&nbsp; Therefore,
if profit is your goal, you should raise price when demand is inelastic.</p>
<p>Even if profit is not your only goal, if you need to support yourself partly through sales, you will be tempted to raise the price on any service for which the demand is inelastic.</p>
<p>This shows the problem with relying on the free give and take of supply and demand to set prices for health care services for which the demand is inelastic.  With inelastic demand, there's always a reward for raising prices.  That is why emergency department prices are so high.  </p>
