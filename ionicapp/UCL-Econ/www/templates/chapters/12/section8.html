<p class="question">Obamacare is requiring health insurance companies to pay out -- for health care -- at least 85% of their premiums.  Does this make health insurance a fair bet?
<br><input type="radio" name="risk4" value="yes">Yes, fair.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="risk4" value="no">No, not fair.</input>  
<div id="risk4-answer"></div>
<p class="question">If investors think that the probability has gone up that a certain security
will not pay off, what happens to the price of the security?
<br><input type="radio" name="risk5" value="down">The price should go down.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="risk5" value="up">The price should go up.</input>  
<br><input type="radio" name="risk5" value="no">The price should not change.</input>     
<div id="risk5-answer"></div>

<p class="question">Why do we need to distinguish risk from undercertainty?
<br><input type="radio" name="risk6" value="dont">We don't.  A statistical analysis of the past will tell you what you need to know about the future.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="risk6" value="do">We do.  Risk is about probabilities.  Probabilities can change.</input>
