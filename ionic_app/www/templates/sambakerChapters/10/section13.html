Internal Rate of Return -- Review and Summary</h2></center>
An income stream for an investment is all of the investment's costs and
payoffs, along with when each cost and payoff will happen.
<p>The present value of an investment is the amount of money you'd need
now to be able to duplicate the investment's income stream. The present
value is calculated using a discount rate which you set to equal your bank's
interest rate or the rate of return of your best alternative investment.</p>
<p>The internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the present
value of the investment's costs and payoffs add up to 0.</p>

<h2>
From the applications:</h2></center>
The yield to maturity of a discounted bond equals its internal rate of
return.
<p>Investments with higher internal rates of return attract money away
from investments with lower internal rates of return.</p>
<p>If a kind of investment has a persistently high internal rate of return,
something is preventing the market from reaching a competitive equilibrium.</p>
<p>Regulation can reduce the rate of return to innovation, just by delaying
the payoffs. How to protect the public without stifling innovation is a
major problem of regulation, in pharmaceuticals, for example.</p>

<h2>
Perils of Using the Internal Rate of Return</h2></center>
The internal rate of return is <b>not</b> a good way evaluate an investment
that has costs later rather than just earlier.&nbsp; An example of that
would be an investment that generates an environmental problem that will
require a cleanup at the end of the income stream.&nbsp; For some such
investments, the <b>worse</b> investments have the higher internal rates
of return. Please see the next tutorial</a>.
