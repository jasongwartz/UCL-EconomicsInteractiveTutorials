        The discount rate that makes the total present value as close as you can get to $0 with this number of decimal places is 4.19%. The regulatory delay drops the internal rate of return to below what you can get from the bank. No one will invest in one of these machines now.

One way this machine's products could come to market would be if the prices for the machine's products go up. The prices would have to rise enough to make the internal rate of return as high as the bank's 5%. In this way, consumers wind up paying for the regulatory delay in higher prices. Notice that I didn't add any paperwork or testing cost to the calculations. The higher prices are purely because of the delay and the need to compete with other investments. Adding in the paperwork cost of complying with regulations would make the internal rate of return even lower.

Another way this machine's products could come to market would be if the price of the machine goes down. Like the discounted bond, a discount in the price of the machine would raise the internal rate of return. In this circumstance, the machine's manufacturer would pay the delay cost of the regulation. The numbers here imply that the price would have to drop to $967 from $1000 to get the IRR up to just over 5%.

<h2>
Internal Rate of Return -- Review and Summary</h2></center>
An income stream for an investment is all of the investment's costs and
payoffs, along with when each cost and payoff will happen.
<p>The present value of an investment is the amount of money you'd need
now to be able to duplicate the investment's income stream. The present
value is calculated using a discount rate which you set to equal your bank's
interest rate or the rate of return of your best alternative investment.</p>
<p>The internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the present
value of the investment's costs and payoffs add up to 0.</p>

<h2>
From the applications:</h2></center>
The yield to maturity of a discounted bond equals its internal rate of
return.
<p>Investments with higher internal rates of return attract money away
from investments with lower internal rates of return.</p>
<p>If a kind of investment has a persistently high internal rate of return,
something is preventing the market from reaching a competitive equilibrium.</p>
<p>Regulation can reduce the rate of return to innovation, just by delaying
the payoffs. How to protect the public without stifling innovation is a
major problem of regulation, in pharmaceuticals, for example.</p>

<h2>
Perils of Using the Internal Rate of Return</h2></center>
The internal rate of return is <b>not</b> a good way evaluate an investment
that has costs later rather than just earlier.&nbsp; An example of that
would be an investment that generates an environmental problem that will
require a cleanup at the end of the income stream.&nbsp; For some such
investments, the <b>worse</b> investments have the higher internal rates
of return. Please see the next tutorial</a>.
