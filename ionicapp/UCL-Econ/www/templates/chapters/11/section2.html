		<h4> Net Present Value</h4>
 The <b>net present value</b> of an income stream is the sum of the present 
values of the individual amounts in the income stream. Each future income
amount in the stream is <b>discounted</b>, meaning that it is divided by
a number representing the opportunity cost of holding capital from now (year
0) until the year when income is received or the outgo is spent. The opportunity
cost can either be how much you would have earned investing the money someplace
else, or how much interest you would have had to pay if you borrowed money.
See the <a href="../dis/dis.html">interactive lecture on discounting future
income</a> for more explanation. That tutorial has a nifty <a href="../dis/dis.html#spreadsheet">spreadsheet setup for  calculating present
values</a> that you can copy and use in your own spreadsheet. 
<blockquote>The word "net" in "net present value" indicates that our calculation 
  <br>
includes the initial costs as well as the subsequent profits. It also reminds 
  <br>
us that all the amounts in the income stream are net profits, revenues <br>
minus cost. In other words, "net" means the same as "total" here.</blockquote>
 The net present value of an investment tells you how this investment compares 
either with your alternative investment or with borrowing, whichever applies 
to you. A positive net present value means this investment is better.
A negative net present value means your alternative investment, or not borrowing,
is better.

 Let's assume that the discount rate (the interest rate that you could earn 
elsewhere or at which you could borrow) will not change over the life of the
project. This makes the calculation simpler. With this assumption, we can
use the usual formula: </p>
<p><strong>Present Value</strong> of any one income amount = <strong>(Income amount) / ( (1 + Discount 
Rate) to the <i>a</i> power)</strong> </p>
<p><strong><i>a</i></strong> is the number of years into the future that the income amount
will be received (or spent, if the income amount is negative). </p>
<p>The net present value (NPV) of a whole income stream is the sum
of these present values of the individual amounts in the income stream. If we still assume that income comes or goes in annual bursts and that the discount rate will be constant in the future, then the NPV has this formula: </p>
