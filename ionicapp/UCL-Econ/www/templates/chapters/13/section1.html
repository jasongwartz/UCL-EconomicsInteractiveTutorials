Risk Aversion and Insurance</h1>

<p>The <a href="../risk/risk.html">interactive tutorial on risk</a>
calculated the expected values of some games and securities. It made
a connection between the expected value of a security and its market price.
This use of the expected value is based on the Law of Large Numbers, which
is a statement about what happens when a game is repeated over and over
and over again. If a game can be repeated many times, good luck and
bad luck tend to wash out.
<p>What happens, though, if the game isn't going to be repeated over and
over?&nbsp; What if it's only played once, or a few times, in your life?&nbsp;
What if the stakes are very high, so that you are gambling with something
that you really do not want to lose? That's when <b>risk aversion</b> comes
in.
<p><b>Risk averse</b> means being willing to pay money to avoid playing
a risky game, even when the expected value of the game is in your favor.
<p>Let's find out how risk averse you are. If you are a student, I'm guessing
that $10,000 is a lot of money for you. A gift of $10,000 would make your
life noticeably easier. Losing $10,000 would make your life noticeably
harder. If you're a well-paid executive or professor (Ha! Ha!), multiply
my dollar numbers by ten, or a hundred.
<p>Imagine that you're a contestant on a TV game show. You have just won
$10,000. The host offers you a choice: You can quit now and keep the $10,000,
or you can play again. If you play again, there is a 0.5 probability that
you will win again, and wind up with $20,000. If you play again and lose,
you lose your $10,000 and take home nothing. You quickly calculate that
the expected value of playing again is $10,000, the same as sticking with
the $10,000 you have won so far. <span class="question">Which do you chose?</span>
<br>
<input type="radio" name="riska1" value="keep">Keep the $10,000.  Don't take the 50-50 chance to get $20,000.
<br><input type="radio" name="riska1" value="play">Play again, with an 0.5 chance of getting $20,000, and an 0.5 chance of going back to $0.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="riska1" value="either">I could go either way.  They are worth the same to me.</input>
<div id="riska1-answer" class="question"></div>
<p>Did your answer to the question above show risk aversion?  If it did, 
let's try to measure how risk averse you are. We can
do this by changin the game in one of two ways:
<ol>
<li>
We can raise the payoff for winning on the second play above $20,000, and
see if you still choose to stick with the sure $10,000.</li>

<li>
Alternatively, we can raise the probability of winning on the second play,
and see if that changes your choice.</li>
</ol>
Either of those alternatives raises the expected value of playing again,
so that it's above $10,000.&nbsp; If we raise the expected value of playing
again, will that induce you to take a chance?&nbsp; Let's see...
<p>For example, would raising the payoff to $22,000 for winning the second
time enough to get you to take the risk and play?  <span class="question">Which would you choose?"</span>
<br>
    <input type="radio" name="riska2" value="keep">Stop with $10,000.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="riska2" value="play">Play again, with an 0.5 chance of getting $22,000, and an 0.5 chance of going back to $0.</input>
<div id="riska2-answer" class="question"></div>
<p>Let's take the next step: How high would the payoff on the second
game have to be to entice you to take the risk, rather than keep the sure
$10,000?
<p class="question">You would risk losing $10000 in return for a 50-50 chance of finishing with <br>$<input id="riska3-response" name="riska3" type="text"></input>.  
<br><button id="riska3-button">Type a number in the box.<br>No commas, please.<br>Then click this.</button>
<div id="riska3-answer" class="question"></div>
<p>The higher your answer was to that question, the more risk averse you are.
