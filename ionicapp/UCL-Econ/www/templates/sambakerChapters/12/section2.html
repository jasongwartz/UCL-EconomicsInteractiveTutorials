<h3>
Probability</h3>
<!--(I adapted this section from my <a href="../../J716/a01/stat.html">brief review of statistical concepts</a> 
for <a href="../../716.html">HSPM J716</a>.)-->
<p>The <b>probability</b> of an event is a fraction between 0 and 1.
<p>1 is the probability of an event that is sure to happen. The probability
that the sun will rise tomorrow is 1.
<p>0 is the probability of an event that cannot happen. The probability
that the Gamecocks will win a football national championship is 0. (Ha!
Ha! Just a joke. Maybe Coach Spurrier can do it!)
<p>Here's how you get probabilities between 0 and 1: Suppose there are
a number of equally likely events. Some events represent a "win"
and some a "loss." The probability of winning is the number of winning
events divided by the total number of events. Such well-defined situations
arise in practice only in games.
<blockquote>For example, consider a coin with a "heads" side and a "tails"
side. If we assume that the two sides are equally likely to be up when
the coin is tossed and lands on a table, then the probability of "heads"
is 1/2 and the probability of "tails" is 1/2.

space has a number and a color. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, and so forth up
to 36, plus a 0 and a 00. Eighteen of the spaces are red. Eighteen
are black. Two, the 0 and the 00, are green. 
<p>The croupier rolls the little ball along the rim of the bowl, while spinning the wheel of numbers and spaces in the opposite direction.  The selected number is the space where the ball finishes.  The ball is equally likely to land in each space.  If you bet that the ball will
fall in a red space, your probability of winning is 18/38.</blockquote>

<p class="question"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A55fRAoLL._AA200_.jpg" alt="playing cards" align="right">A deck of playing cards has 52 different cards (if we remove the Jokers).  I draw a card at random from that deck.  What is the probability that the card will be the Queen of Diamonds?
