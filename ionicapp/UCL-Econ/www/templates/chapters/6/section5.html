		<h3>When does raising your price bring in more money?</h3>
<p>For demand, there's a relationship between the elasticity and what happens
to total revenue from customers when you change your price:
<table><tr valign="top"><td>If demand is elastic</td>
<td>(if the elasticity is more negative than -1)</td>
<td>then if the
price goes up,<br>the total amount customers spend goes down.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>If demand is inelastic</td>
<td>(if the elasticity is between -1 and 0)</td>
<td>then if the
price goes up,<br>the total amount customers spend goes up.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>If you have unitary elasticity</td>
<td>(if the elasticity of demand is exactly -1)</td>
<td>then if the
price goes up,<br>the total amount customers spend stays the same.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Let's see how this works in our example: At a price of $10, you
sell 100 tests per month. <span class="question">What is the total revenue (price times quantity)?</span>
<br><input id="Elas210-response" name="Elas210" type="text"></input>
<button id="Elas210-button">Type a number in the box.  Then click this.</button>
<div id="Elas210-answer"></div>
<p>When the price is $30, you do 60 tests per month. <span class="question">What is that total
revenue?</span>
<br><input id="Elas211-response" name="Elas211" type="text"></input>
<button id="Elas211-button">Type a number in the box.  Then click this.</button>
<div id="Elas211-answer"></div>
<br>So, raising the price from $10 to $30 does what to total revenue? 
<br><input type="radio" name="q12" value="up">Revenue goes up.</input>
<input type="radio" name="q12" value="down">Revenue goes down.</input>
<div id="q12-answers"></div>

<p>Our calculated elasticity was -0.5, which we called "inelastic" because
its absolute value was less than 1. <span class="question">Is this consistent with the idea that revenue
going up when the price goes up?</span> 
<br><input type="radio" name="q13" value="yes">Yes</input>
<input type="radio" name="q13" value="no">No</input>
<div id="q13-answers"></div>
<p>This is how elasticity of demand relates to pricing strategy. <span class="question">If your demand is
inelastic, how would you change your price to bring in more money? </span>
<br><input type="radio" name="q14" value="raise">Raise price if demand is inelastic.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="q14" value="lower">Lower price if demand is inelastic.</input>
<div id="q14-answers"></div>
<p>Suppose that you were in charge of setting prices at a hospital.  You offer trauma services in your emergency department.  You also offer counseling for weight control in your education department.  Each of those services has an incremental cost, mainly for personnel and supplies to provide the service.  Your hospital also has overhead costs, like the construction loan for your building and your salary as an administrator.  To get the revenue to cover the overhead costs, you will have to mark up the prices on some services to levels well above what is needed to cover just the incremental costs.  Think about the price elasticity of demand for emergency department services and for education department services.  
<br><span class="question">Which department's prices will you mark up by a lot?</span>
<br><input type="radio" name="q15" value="emergency">Emergency department</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="q15" value="education">Education department</input>
<div id="q15-answers"></div>
<p>We have said that demand is called "inelastic" if the price-elasticity is between 0 and -1.  Suppose the demand is perfectly inelastic.  No response of quantity to price differences.  <span class="question">What is the elasticity number if demand is perfectly inelastic?</span>
<br><input type="radio" name="q16" value="0">0</input>
<input type="radio" name="q16" value="-1">-1</input>
<input type="radio" name="q16" value="-infinity">&minus;&infin;</input>
<div id="q16-answers"></div>

<p>What if demand were elastic? <span class="question">How would you change your price to bring
in more money?</span> 
<br><input type="radio" name="q17" value="raise">Raise price if demand is elastic.</input>
<br><input type="radio" name="q17" value="lower">Lower price if demand is elastic.</input>
<div id="q17-answers"></div>

<p>Elastic demand typically happens when you are a small player in a big
market, and there's a going market price. Undercut that price, and you
attract business. Whether you make a profit depends on your costs, but
that's a subject for another tutorial.
<p>The extreme form of elastic demand is perfectly elastic demand.  Perfectly elastic demand means you can sell as much as you want at the going market price.  People will buy a practically unlimited amount at the current price, with no need for price cuts to get people to take more.
<p clsas="question">What is the elasticity number if demand is perfectly elastic?
<br><input type="radio" name="q18" value="0">0</input>
<input type="radio" name="q18" value="-1">-1</input>
<input type="radio" name="q18" value="-infinity">&minus;&infin;</input>
<div id="q18-answers"></div>
<p>
Small sellers of commodities (standardized products) in big markets can have demand that is perfectly elastic.  A small farmer, for example, may find that the market will take all he or she can produce at the going price.
