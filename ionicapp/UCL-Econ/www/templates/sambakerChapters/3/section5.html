<h1>Innovation to stay ahead, temporarily</h1>
<p>There's another way that Joan's might deal with a low price for her product.
That would be to reduce her minimum average cost below $2900. A typical
way to do that would be to buy labor-saving equipment. Her fixed cost would
go up (paying off the loan that enabled her to buy the equipment), but
variable cost would go down (less labor means less paying less in total
wages.)</p>
<p>Below is what Joan's costs might look like now:</p>

<p>Can Joan's now make profit if the price is $2900?</p>

<br /><p>How many patients should Joan's serve to maximize profit at the $2900
price?</p>
<br /><applet CODE="ACost16.class" CODEBASE="./" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN="TOP"></applet>

<p>With the old technology, Joan's treated 5 patients and just broke even, when the price was $2900. With the new cost-cutting technology, Joan's expands her output rate to 8.</p>

<p>If all the firms in the industry adopt the new technology, so that all the firms have costs just like Joan's, then every firm will try to expand its output just as Joan's did.  Which way will the price go?</p>
<br /><applet CODE="ACost17.class" CODEBASE="./" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN="TOP"></applet>

<p>My analysis assumes that there is price competition in this market. By contrast, Brown, M.L., Kessler, L.G., Reuter, F.G., "Is the
Supply of Mammography Machines Outstripping Need and Demand?" Annals
of Internal Medicine, October, 1, 1990, 113(7), pp. 547-552, found that prices of screening mammograms stayed high despite a great increase in supply, because there was no price competition. I am assuming a textbook type of perfect competition in the market that Joan's is in.</p>

<p>Suppose, though, that competition doesn't work, and the price stays up at $2900.  In that case, the firms will want to treat 8 patients each, but there won't be enough patients to go around.  Many will have to settle for fewer than 8 patients.  What is Joan's minimum break even output rate?</p>
